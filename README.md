# Innovation Funding Service Project

Grant management system.

# Quick Installation

Before starting make sure you have the following installed

* Linux or MacOS environment
* Docker - increase Docker memory allocation to at least 8GiB
* Java 8

Update your /etc/hosts file to include

```
127.0.0.1 ifs.local-dev
127.0.0.1 auth.local-dev
127.0.0.1 ifs-database
127.0.0.1 ifs-finance-database
127.0.0.1 ifs-survey-database
```

Create docker network

    docker network create ifs

Copy the properties from the starter.properties file into ~/.gradle/gradle.properties - your local gradle properties
file.

Before you can build the project for the first time, you need to generate the certificates to be used by IDP, SP and LDAP services.
Once generated these certificates can be found in the appropriate services under src/main/docker/certs

    ./gradlew generateCertificates -x test

Build and deploy

    ./gradlew clean build deploy wait syncShib -Pinitialise=true -x test

Access https://ifs.local-dev with one of the following users (with password "Passw0rd")

* steve.smith@empire.com - lead applicant
* john.doe@innovateuk.test - competition admin
* lee.bowman@innovateuk.test - project finance

# Further configuration

You can enable various services in your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and then re-build if you wish to run more of the
stack.  Note that you may need to allocate some more memory in Docker preferences for this, increasing to 12GiB is
enough for most developer requirements.

# Gradle Tasks

Gradle is efficient - it wont re-run tasks if it doesn't need to (--rerun-tasks overrides this behaviour if you want).
If a jar has been built and no source files have changed it wont build the jar again.


| Task          | Description
|---------------|--------------
| build         | Build artifacts
| clean         | Clean up resources generated during build
| deploy        | Deploy docker service.
| flywayClean   | Drops all tables in the configured schemas
| flywayMigrate | Apply changes to schema to get system up to date
| stop          | Stops docker service.
| syncShib      | Syncs user data from database to LDAP after database initialisation.
| test          | Run tests to assert build quality, e.g. unit tests
| wait          | Wait until docker container is deployed

| Options            | Description
|--------------------|--------------
| -Pinitialise=true  | Redeploy core services, e.g. data base, that typically don't change during a build cycle
| -x test            | Ignore test task

## Typical combinations

Deploy a branch for the first time with out full test suite

    ./gradlew clean build deploy wait syncShib -Pinitialise=true -x test

Redeploy my changed jar files (no database changes)

    ./gradlew clean build deploy wait -x test

Redeploy a specific service

    ./gradlew ifs-web-service:ifs-application-service:deploy wait

I have made database changes only

    ./gradlew flywayClean flywayMigrate

I am a tester and want to deploy my system for testing

    ./robot_tests/micro_run_tests

I am a tester and I want to swap to a new branch for testing

    ./gradlew stop -Pinitialise=true && ./robot_tests/micro_run_tests

Running a gradle task for only web services (eg. test)

    ./gradlew test -p ifs-web-service

Create asciidoc

    ./gradlewe clean asciidoctorOnly
