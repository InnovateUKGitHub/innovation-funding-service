            <p>11.2.2) if, in the opinion of the TSB, compliance does not avoid or remove the conflict, The TSB may determine the Contract and recover from the Contractor the amount of any loss resulting from such determination.</p>
            <p>11.3 Where the TSB is of the opinion that the conflict of interest which existed at the time of the award of the Contract could have been discovered with the application by the Contractor of due diligence and ought to have been disclosed as required by the tender documents pertaining to it, the TSB may determine the Contract immediately for breach of a fundamental condition and, without prejudice to any other rights, recover from the Contractor the amount of any loss resulting from such determination.</p>
