                        Successful and unsuccessful applicants must give us, and any data-sharing partner we appoint, any information we need to create an evaluation report. For successful applicants this will be during the term of the grant and for a further period as specified in your GOL.
                    </li>

            <li>
                Payment of grant
                <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                    <li>We will only pay your grant into your business account at a UK clearing bank or one of its subsidiary banks within the UK. Innovate UK may accept an account at an alternative bank in exceptional circumstances at our discretion and by prior agreement. Your grant will be paid by instalments quarterly (unless otherwise agreed by Innovate UK) and in arrears on submission of a claim. This will be for your net eligible costs incurred, invoiced and paid in the quarter (or other period) covered by the claim. You accept that the eligible costs you can claim are limited to those types of costs approved by our Project Finance Team and communicated to you before the issue of the GOL. </li>
                    <li>You will discuss and provide evidence on request for each grant claim with your MO before they can approve and submit your claim for payment to Innovate UK.</li>
                    <li>Your claims must be supported by a revised forecast of eligible project costs. These should detail expected costs for each future claim period and highlight any variations from the last forecast. Your claim might need to be supported by an independent accountant’s report as set out in clause 9 below.</li>
                    <li>
                        Claims must be for completed quarters only. The exception is the final quarter which is the only occasion when you can submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:
                        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>for labour, overhead and/or travel and subsistence only</li>
                            <li>paid within 30 days of the project end date, and</li>
                            <li>included within the final independent accountant’s report</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Innovate UK will normally pay the grant within 30 days, unless we need further information to support the claim. We agree to raise requests for further information, if any, within 14 days of receiving the claim. </li>
                    <li>Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it relates. We will not pay any claims received later than 3 months after project completion.</li>
                    <li>Innovate UK has the right not to consider new grant applications from organisations who have failed to return required financial reports on any previous projects funded by Innovate UK. </li>
                    <li>
                        Innovate UK will retain 15% of your maximum grant value until the project is complete and we have received:
                        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>any outstanding claims</li>
                            <li>supporting information</li>
                            <li>final project report</li>
                            <li>final independent accountant’s report (FAR)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Payment of the retained value (15%) is subject to the contents of the final accountant’s report. Adjustments may mean that you are not entitled to receive all of the retained value.
                    </li>
                    <li>You are responsible for maintaining detailed records and documentation relating to the use of your grant. These should provide sufficient evidence to support the submission of timely and accurate claims and to demonstrate that your eligible project costs comply with all state aid rules, as outlined in paragraph 9. These records must be kept for 10 years following your receipt of the grant and must be supplied to satisfy European Commission requests for evidence of compliance within 20 days if requested.</li>
                    <li>Innovate UK may appoint an auditor, at our expense, to ensure you are complying with the terms and conditions of this agreement. You agree to give the auditor access to your project records within 2 weeks’ notice of their appointment. If the auditor determines that all or part of the grant has been misapplied or that you should repay all or part of the grant to Innovate UK, we may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.</li>

                Monitoring
                <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                    <li>Innovate UK is required to demonstrate to UK Research and Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) the effective performance management of project delivery. Your project will be monitored by Innovate UK's project monitoring service.</li>
                    <li>Throughout the term of your project, your progress is monitored by Innovate UK through your Monitoring Officer (MO). Your MO is your first point of contact for official notifications, queries and correspondence with Innovate UK, unless otherwise required by this agreement. You should comply with any reasonable request for information and deadlines by your MO.</li>
                    <li>Your project manager, and others as may be agreed from time to time, will meet with your MO once a calendar quarter (or agreed period) to review your written report for the period since the last monitoring meeting. You should deliver this report to your MO no later than 14 days before the scheduled monitoring meeting.</li>
                    <li>
                        Your MO will require you to provide satisfactory evidence of project delivery in the following 3 aspects:
                        <ol class="govuk-list--number">
                            <li>Technical assurance.</li>

                        </ol>
                        Failure to provide satisfactory evidence in any one of these areas will prevent your MO from validating your claims.

You must ensure at all times that you are compliant with the State Aid regulations under which you have been awarded. Further information about the regulations can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovate-uk-funding-general-guidance-for-applicants#state-aid" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">section on State Aid</a> in Innovate UK’s general guidance for applicants.</li>
                    <li>You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this award of grant. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding and aid intensity you are receiving for the project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER. You must ensure you comply with State Aid rules, which are those rules contained in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/provisions.html" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Articles 107 to 109 of Section 2, Title VII, of the Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws</a>, Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2008/C 115/01). </li>
                    <li>Innovate UK will immediately stop grant payments to you in any and all projects if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous European Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received as illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</li>
                    <li>Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful State Aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</li>
                    <li>No subcontract can be made which would constitute a breach of State Aid obligations.</li>
                    <li>You acknowledge that in compliance with EU Treaty obligations, Innovate UK may be required to provide the European Commission with information about the financial assistance given to it by Innovate UK and shall provide such assistance as Innovate UK shall reasonably request.</li>
