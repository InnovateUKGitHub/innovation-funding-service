        <ol class="govuk-list list-alpha">
            <li>These terms and conditions, together with Innovate UK’s policies and guidance notes apply to all organisations applying for grant funding. This is either individually or in collaboration. Each organisation must accept these terms and conditions before submitting an application.</li>
            <li>Whilst this is an Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) UK competition, Innovate UK is the funding body and any grant which is awarded will be payable by Innovate UK subject to these terms and conditions. The role of APC, the services it provides and the related responsibilities of project participants are described in Schedule 1 at the end of these terms and conditions.</li>
            <li>Whether a grant is awarded depends upon whether you are successful in the APC competition. If successful, the lead organisation receives a grant offer letter confirming any project-specific conditions of the grant. This letter must be countersigned and uploaded by the lead organisation as detailed in the application, before the project can start. Neither Innovate UK nor APC have any obligations under these terms and conditions including Schedule 1 unless or until the lead organisation signs and uploads the grant offer letter in the correct manner.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. General terms and conditions</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK has the right to change these grant terms and conditions unilaterally and at any time by giving 1 months’ notice.</p>
        <p>You cannot assign, transfer or sub-contract any of your rights or obligations under this agreement to any third party.</p>
        <p>Rights and/or remedies under this grant, whether exercised or not, remain available throughout the life of the grant.</p>
        <p>A grant does not create any partnership or joint venture at law.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>accepts no liability for any consequences, whether direct or indirect, that may come about by undertaking the project, using the grant, or ending the grant</li>
            <li>limits its liability to the amount of eligible costs that can be evidenced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our grants are subject to the laws of England and Wales.</p>
        <p>A grant cannot be used for any political or lobbying activity or purpose.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Duration</h2>
        <p>These terms and conditions come into effect from the start date until the end date provided in the grant offer letter, or until the grant is terminated (taking into account section 12).</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Your obligations</h2>
        <p>If your application is successful, you agree to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>make sure that the project is managed in accordance with your project proposal and all terms and conditions of this grant</li>
            <li>carry out the project with reasonable skill and care</li>
            <li>use appropriately skilled personnel as would be expected of a similar organisation working in the same or similar field</li>
            <li>inform Innovate UK promptly, through your Monitoring Officer (MO), and APC of any issue or material change that may affect the progress, delivery or exploitation of the project</li>
            <li>provide information of the economic outputs that have arisen because of the project. You will provide these annually for the life of the project and where requested, for up to 5 years after the project has completed</li>
            <li>give Innovate UK permission to use your organisation’s name and address, the project name, project description, logo and grant value details in order to publicise your project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within 3 months of the completion of the project, you will:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>provide confirmation that the final claim and final Independent Accountant’s Report have been submitted</li>
            <li>provide any final documentation required by the funding body Innovate UK</li>
            <li>support reasonable requests to promote the project and its outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The grant is subject to the project starting within 90 days from our email notification to you (unless we have agreed a longer time frame with you in writing). Innovate UK has the right to withdraw the grant offer if the partners do not complete their project and bank details within 30 days of notification. This information is needed so that we can start our pre-project checks.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">4. Payment of grant</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK will pay your grant by instalments quarterly and in arrears on submission of a claim, unless otherwise agreed in your grant offer letter. You can only claim the net eligible costs you have incurred and paid in the 3 month period for which you are submitting the claim.</p>
        <p>Your claims must be supported by the following:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a revised forecast of eligible project costs which details expected costs for each future claim period and highlights any variations from the last forecast</li>
            <li>an Independent Accountant’s Report (see section 7)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Claims must be for completed quarters only, except for the final quarter where you can submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>for labour, overhead and/or travel and subsistence only</li>
            <li>paid within 30 days of the end of the project</li>
            <li>included within the final Independent Accountant’s Report</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Innovate UK will normally pay the grant within 30 days, unless we need further information to support the claim. If that happens we will contact you within 14 days of receiving your claim.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it relates. We will not pay any claims received later than 3 months after completion of the project.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK has the right not to consider new applications from organisations who have failed to return required financial reports on any projects funded by Innovate UK.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK will not pay more than 85&percnt; of the grant until all outstanding claims and supporting information have been received and the final Independent Accountant’s Report has been approved.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining detailed records and documentation relating to your grant. These should provide evidence that your eligible project costs comply with all state aid rules, as outlined in section 9. These records must be kept for 10 years following the grant and must be supplied as requested within 20 days.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK may appoint an auditor to ensure you are complying with all terms and conditions. You agree to give the auditor access to your project records within 2 weeks of notice of their appointment. If the auditor determines that you should repay the grant to Innovate UK, Innovate UK may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">5. Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Your project will be monitored in accordance with Innovate UK's project monitoring framework. You will meet with your assigned monitoring officer as often as is specified at the start of the project. You will allow them access to your employees, agents, premises, facilities and records to review your progress, and send them any information, explanations and documents requested within 10 days.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">6. Suspension, withdrawal and repayment of grant</h2>
        <p>Failure to adhere to the terms of this grant may lead to Innovate UK suspending, withdrawing or reclaiming the grant in whole or in part.</p>
        <p>If we have concerns that mean we might need to suspend, withdraw or reclaim the grant we will write to inform you and you will then have 30 days in which to address our concerns.</p>
        <p>Examples of events that may result in Innovate UK suspending grant payments include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>misuse of the grant funds, including in a fraudulent or financially misleading way (or for purposes not related to the project)</li>
            <li>false statements in any part of your application or project</li>
            <li>failure to maintain satisfactory progress on the project</li>
            <li>any material changes to the proposed outcomes of the project</li>
            <li>your failure to comply with all terms and conditions</li>
            <li>a breach of state aid rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of events that may result in Innovate UK stopping grant payments include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you fail to resolve to Innovate UK's satisfaction, or it is not possible to resolve, the reasons for suspension</li>
            <li>you have been found to have applied for and secured multiple awards for the same or largely interchangeable project scopes</li>
            <li>you are found to have breached any of Innovate UK’s policies</li>
            <li>you become insolvent, are declared bankrupt, placed into receivership, administration or liquidation, or a petition has been presented for winding up, or any similar arrangements that may affect you financially (including any requirements imposed by GBER (see section 9)</li>
            <li>there is a change to your legal status which you have failed to declare or have misrepresented to us</li>
            <li>you or any project partner has failed to pay any fee payable to APC in accordance with the payment terms set out in Schedule 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not resolve an issue causing suspension or if Innovate UK stop the grant payments Innovate UK may require you to repay some or all of the grant.</p>
        <p>Where an event of force majeure, or a change to the laws of England and Wales, UK government or devolved administration policy and/or the Legal Acts of the European Union occurs which affects Innovate UK’s ability to continue funding your project, we can terminate the grant by giving you as much notice as possible in writing. In such circumstances, Innovate UK will meet its obligations to pay grant against any eligible costs you have reasonably incurred and paid before the date of termination.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">7. Financial reporting</h2>
        <p>You agree to appoint an Independent Accountant who will inspect your financial statements relating to the grant. They will prepare an Independent Accountant’s Report using Innovate UK’s standard template, at the intervals stated in the IAR guidance. The report will certify that:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the financial information and level of grant claimed are accurate and legitimate</li>
            <li>eligible costs that you have submitted have been properly incurred and paid</li>
            <li>you have provided satisfactory explanations for any queries raised by the Independent Accountant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must appoint an Independent Accountant in a manner consistent with Innovate UK’s Standard Terms of Engagement of Accountants.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances, you can be asked to provide your latest published annual accounts or management accounts. Accounts should be provided unless doing so would breach any law, order or regulation restricting such disclosure.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK can also require you to submit an Accountant’s Report if any of the following occur:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you withdraw from the project</li>
            <li>the project is terminated</li>
            <li>you submit a claim disclosing expenditure substantially greater than forecast</li>
            <li>you are suspected of breaching any terms and conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">8. Confidentiality and information management</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK has the right to request access to any additional information we feel necessary in connection with this grant. You must provide or allow access to such information within 2 weeks of a request. Innovate UK will treat your information in accordance with our policies and personal information charter.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">9. State Aid obligations</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK awards funding through its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovate-uk-funding-general-guidance-for-applicants" title="General guidance for grant applicants">Research, Development and Innovation Scheme</a> operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (“the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)”).</p>
        <p>You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this offer. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding you are receiving for a project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK will stop grant payments if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</p>
        <p>Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any award to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful State Aid, interest will be charged. This is on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</p>
        <p>No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of State Aid obligations.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">10. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK will not own any intellectual property rights (IPRs) developed during or as a result of the project.</p>
        <p>You will make commercially reasonable enquiries to ensure that you have the necessary rights to use or access third party IPR needed to carry out the Project.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">11. Exploitation of project results</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK expects you to refine and update your Exploitation Plan over the project lifetime.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">12. UK statutory framework</h2>
        <p>Innovate UK is required to comply with all legislation in England and Wales. We particularly draw to your attention the data protection legislation, the Bribery Act 2010, the Fraud Act 2006 and the Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p>
        <p>Innovate UK expects you to comply with all legislation (including in the Devolved Authorities) where they apply to you and to act in a way that does not impact our ability to comply.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">13. Dispute resolution</h2>
        <p>Where a dispute arises between you and Innovate UK, we would advise your Chief Executive Officer to contact us to discuss, in good faith, how the matter can be resolved. If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be found, the parties agree to refer the matter to the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), whose decision will be binding.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">14. Fee for APC Services</h2>
        <p>You and each project partner (including Academic and RTO partners) will be required to pay a fee to APC for the services it provides, as outlined in Schedule 1. This fee will be calculated as 3.5&percnt; of the value of the grant paid to each project partner and will be payable in accordance with the payment terms set out in Schedule 1.</p>
        <p>This is an absolute condition of the award of your grant.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Schedule 1</h2>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your relationship with the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK Ltd</h3>
        <p>This schedule provides an overview of the relationship and requirements between you and the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) UK Ltd with respect to the grant.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Support from APC and payments to APC</h3>
        <p>APC will work with you to give support:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>during the application, project monitoring and close out phases</li>
            <li>with industry engagement events for the project team</li>
            <li>in reporting overall progress to the Automotive Council UK and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An APC representative will work with your project to support these activities.</p>
        <p>APC will be remunerated for the services it provides, as outlined in section 14 of these terms and conditions. All project partners must comply with this requirement.</p>
        <p>This fee will be invoiced by APC, on a quarterly basis, to each project partner in line with submission of claims to Innovate UK. Unless otherwise agreed between APC and a project partner, project partners are expected to pay the fee within 30 days of the invoice date.</p>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, APC is VAT registered in the United Kingdom, and will charge VAT, where applicable, at the prevailing rate.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Publication of Information</h3>
        <p>Innovate UK and APC publicise the results of competitions and applications. This includes, but is not limited to, posting material on their websites, making references to projects at events, social media activity, references in presentation material and engagement with the media. In accepting the grant award, the participants each agree to Innovate UK and APC making publicly available on their websites the project title, the public description of the project, and the corporate identities of the project participants.</p>
        <p>The participants are actively encouraged to seek their own publicity. APC (and, in exceptional circumstances and at all times in coordination with APC, Innovate UK) can however, have specific requirements with regards to the timing of communication activities. For instance this could be occasions when a government announcement is due to take place involving a specific competition or project. If this happens, APC (or, in exceptional circumstances and at all times in coordination with APC, Innovate UK) will contact the participants to request its publicity is aligned with the government announcement and that the participants defer any publicity until an agreed date.</p>
        <p>Should the participants wish to publicise the project (including by way of industrial events, direct public engagement or via media outlets) it is requested that the participants advise APC in advance, where possible.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Core Projects Publication Request and Asset Release Form</h3>
        <p>The lead organisation will provide the APC with a copy of the Core Projects Publication Request and Asset Release Form. This will be supplied to the lead organisation following the notification of grant award. All project participants are required to complete their respective sections of this form.</p>
        <p>Any information provided by a project participant in this form may become publicly accessible.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4. Annual review</h3>
        <p>Your project is subject to an annual review. This is in addition to the Quarterly Review Meetings (referred to in the Innovate UK project-monitoring framework).</p>
        <p>You are required to present an updated strategic rationale for the project to representatives of the APC and BEIS and Innovate UK.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the review is to understand how changes in business environments have altered:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the strategic alignment of the project partners with the outputs of the project</li>
            <li>the commercial viability of the technologies and other outputs developed through the project</li>
            <li>the commitment of the project partners to finance the next stages of the project and the ensuing commercialisation of technologies developed through the project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The review meetings are held within 3 months of each anniversary of the project start date.</p>
        <p>APC will agree the date, content and structure of the review with the lead organisation in advance.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the annual review may result in further items for attention or issues that require resolution. Following the annual review and where appropriate, the Innovate UK Monitoring Officer will follow the monitoring officer guidelines and take appropriate action.</p>
