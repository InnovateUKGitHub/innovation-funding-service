                <li>
                    I am pleased to inform you that Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation (“Innovate UK”) acting on behalf of government funding organisations, is prepared to offer <th:block th:text="${model.leadOrgName}" />  ("the Knowledge Base Partner") a grant not exceeding [£Value30 (fEC) or £Value33 (non-fEC)] under Section 96 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. This is towards the Knowledge Base Partner’s costs of undertaking with <th:block th:text="${model.partnerOrgName}" /> (“the Business”) a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (“the Partnership”) in accordance with the application submitted to Innovate UK. This award is subject to the terms and conditions of this grant offer letter (GOL) and its Schedules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The funding organisation(s) that have agreed to fund the grant to the Partnership at the time of issuing this GOL are identified above.  During the Partnership, some or all of the funding may be reallocated to other funding organisations.
                    At the time of preparing any publicity material, you should always check which funding organisations are currently funding the Partnership; this can be confirmed by using the online search facility provided on the KTP website http://ktp.innovateuk.org/.  Any reallocation of funding must not be interpreted as changing the terms of this offer of grant.
                </li>
                <li>General terms and conditions
                    <ol class="govuk-list ifs-list--number">
                        <li>This grant offer is conditional on the Knowledge Base Partner awarding a contract of employment to a potential KTP Associate and this being accepted. This must follow completion of a demonstrably open and fair recruitment process conducted jointly by the Knowledge Base Partner and the Business.
                            The Associate must start work on the Partnership (“the Associate Start Date”) within a period of 9 months after the date of this GOL. The Associate will inform Innovate UK of their Start Date by completing the online Associate registration form.
                            In the case of a Partnership involving more than one Associate project, this GOL is conditional on only the first Associate Start Date being within a period of 9 months after the date of this GOL.  If these conditions are not met, this grant offer will automatically lapse.</li>
                        <li>We have the unilateral right to change these grant terms and conditions at any time, giving 3 months’ notice.</li>
                        <li>You cannot assign, transfer or sub-contract any of your rights or obligations under this agreement without Innovate UK’s express permission.</li>
                        <li>Rights and/or remedies under this GOL, whether exercised or not, remain available throughout the term of this GOL.</li>
                        <li>This agreement does not create any partnership or joint venture between us at law.</li>
                        <li>We:
                            •	Accept no liability for any consequences, whether direct or indirect, that result from you undertaking the Partnership, using the grant, or Innovate UK terminating this agreement or grant;
                            •	Limit our liability to the amount of grant payable for which you can provide evidence of eligible costs incurred and defrayed, provided you are not in breach of its terms.</li>

                23.1	Innovate UK awards grant funding through its Research, Development and Innovation Scheme operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (“the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)”).

                23.2	You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this award of Grant. It is Your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding You are receiving for the Funded Activities does not exceed those limits stated in GBER.

                23.3	Innovate UK will stop Grant payments if You become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous European Commission decision, which declares any aid You have received illegal and incompatible with the internal market.

                23.4	Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful state aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.

                23.5	No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of state aid obligations.

                23.6	Where you are a contracting authority within the meaning of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, Concession Contracts Regulations 2016, Utilities and Contracts Regulations 2016 and Defence Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011, You warrant that You will comply, as necessary, with the applicable procurement laws when procuring goods and services.

                23.7	Where you reasonably consider that there is an objective justification for not complying with procurement rules and seek to rely on such justification, You will seek Our prior approval for doing so, setting out the reasons for non-compliance in a structured business case.

                23.8	You must not confer either directly or indirectly any Selective Advantage in breach of State Aid Regulations.

                23.9	You must notify Innovate UK in the event that you are proposing to confer selective advantage and if you have conferred selective advantage either directly or indirectly
                23.10	You must seek independent legal advice regarding State Aid and your compliance with these obligations as part of the grant funding.
