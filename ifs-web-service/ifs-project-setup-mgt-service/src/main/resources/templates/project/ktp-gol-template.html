                            <p>You accept that the eligible costs you can claim are limited to those as detailed in Schedule 1 of this GOL.</p></li>
                        <li>Your claims must be supported by a revised forecast of eligible Partnership costs. These should detail expected costs for each future claim period and highlight any variations from the last forecast. Your claim may be subject to audit review as set out in Paragraph 9.11 below.</li>

In addition, claims must be supported by the minutes of an LMC meeting (“LMC Minutes”) covering part or all of the period of the claim. Alternatively you can send by way of emails from one each of the knowledge base and business LMC team members and the KTA, approving a financial statement covering the period of the claim when there has been no LMC meeting during or immediately after the period of the claim (“Virtual LMCs”). These documents must be emailed to <a href="mailto:ktp_claims@innovateuk.ukri.org">ktp_claims@innovateuk.ukri.org</a> within one month of the end of the period to which the claim refers.</li>

                            <p>In this event, during the period in which work on the Partnership is suspended, the Knowledge Base Partner will continue to submit claims every 3 months, which may include periods of zero expenditure. Claims for expenditure incurred may restart once work on the Partnership recommences.</p></li>
