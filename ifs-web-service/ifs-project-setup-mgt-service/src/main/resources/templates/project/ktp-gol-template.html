This is towards the Knowledge Base Partner’s costs of undertaking with <th:block th:text="${model.partnerOrgName}" /> (“the Business”) a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (“the Partnership”) in accordance with the application submitted to Innovate UK.

If the auditor determines that all or part of the grant has been misapplied or that you should repay all or part of the grant to Innovate UK.
