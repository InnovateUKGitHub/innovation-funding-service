If ownership of the company changes during the course of the grant funded project Innovate UK has the right to suspend or terminate the grant and to recover the value of all the grant monies paid from the beginning of the project.

                <li>Payment of grant
                    <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                        <li>
                            We will only pay your grant into your business account at a UK clearing bank or one of its subsidiary banks within the UK. Innovate UK may accept an account at an alternative bank in exceptional circumstances and at our discretion, and by prior agreement.
                            Your grant will be paid in quarterly instalments (unless otherwise agreed by Innovate UK) and in arrears on submission of a claim. This will be for your net eligible costs incurred, invoiced and paid in the quarter (or other period) covered by the claim.
                            You accept that the eligible costs you can claim are limited to those types of costs approved by our Project Finance Team and communicated to you before the issue of the GOL.
                        </li>
                        <li>You must provide evidence to Innovate UK through the Innovation Funding Service (IFS) for each grant claim. You must discuss costs with your MO before they can approve and submit your claim for payment to Innovate UK.</li>
                        <li>Your claims must be supported by a revised forecast of eligible project costs. These should detail expected costs for each future claim period and highlight any variations from the last forecast. Your claim might need to be supported by an independent accountant’s report as set out in section 14 below.</li>
                        <li>You are required to have a time recording arrangement which allows you to accurately record time charged to Innovate UK projects. All labour claims must be supported by a time recording arrangement which includes:
                           <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                               <li>the date and number of hours worked per day</li>
                               <li>start and finish time</li>
                               <li>a brief description of the work completed and associated work package(s)</li>
                               <li>the name of the staff member completing the task</li>
                               <li>the relevant hourly rate</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Claims must be for completed quarters only. The exception is the final quarter, which is the only occasion when you can submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:
                            <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                                <li>for labour, overhead or travel and subsistence only</li>
                                <li>paid within 30 days of the project end date</li>
                                <li>included within the final independent accountant’s report</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Innovate UK will normally pay the grant within 30 days, unless we need further information to support the claim. We agree to raise requests for further information, if any, within 14 days of receiving the claim.</li>
                        <li>All Claims must be submitted or completed as draft within 30 days of the period end. Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it relates.</li>
                        <li>Innovate UK will retain 10% of your maximum grant value until the project is complete and we have received:
                            <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                                <li>A final claim</li>
                                <li>Supporting claim evidence information</li>
                                <li>The final project report</li>

                            </ol>
                            We will not pay the final claim or the 10% retained value if the items listed above are received later than 90 days after project completion date. Payment of the retained value (10%) is subject to the contents of the final accountant’s report. Adjustments may mean that you are not entitled to receive all of the retained value.
                        </li>
                        <li>Innovate UK may adjust your grant payment profile as detailed in the “Eligible costs and grant allocations table of your GOL, providing you with a 14 day notice period.
                            <ol class="ifs-list--number">
                                <li>This may be applied to all historic claim periods with outstanding or held claims, or where a claim is unpaid.</li>
                                <li>The total grant intervention rate for the project at the end date of the project shall remain unchanged where the payment profile is amended.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>You are responsible for maintaining contemporaneous and detailed records and documentation relating to the use of your grant, including timesheets, invoices and other documents.
                        </li>
                        <li>The time recording system should clearly show when, who and what has been carried out by employees. These should provide sufficient evidence to support the submission of timely and accurate claims and to demonstrate that your eligible project costs comply with the UK Subsidy Control Framework or State Aid Rules (as applicable) and as outlined in section 16.
                        </li>
                        <li>These records must be kept for 10 years following your receipt of the grant and must be supplied to satisfy requests for evidence of compliance within 20 days if requested.
                        Grant recipients should be open and transparent and must provide additional information if asked. For example, this may include details of staff contributing to the project, or the nature of the relationship between the consortium members.
                        </li>
                        <li>Where you use subcontractors, we reserve the right to request further information and conduct further checks. Any relationship between the funded project partner and subcontractor must be declared. The lead project partner must be able to demonstrate that value for money is obtained in the procurement of goods, services or works funded by the grant.
                        The procurement process must reflect that which a participant would typically use concerning its own money, with equal, or greater, vigilance.  A project partner cannot sell services or equipment to other project partners at a profit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Innovate UK may appoint an auditor, at our expense, to ensure you are complying with the terms and conditions of this agreement. You agree to give the auditor or person nominated by UKRI, access to your project records within 2 weeks’ notice of their appointment.
                        If the auditor determines that all or part of the grant has been misapplied or that you should repay all or part of the grant to Innovate UK, we may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.
                        </li>
                        <li>Innovate UK will not make payment for project costs that you are already in receipt of, whether from Innovate UK (in a separate project award) or any other funding organisation.  In the event that separate funding has been awarded for costs associated with the same project deliverables it is the responsibility of you to notify Innovate UK and any other funding organisation. This will allow the awarding organisations to agree who should fund the relevant costs.
                        If you are found to be claiming duplicate project costs whilst in receipt of separate funding (‘double dipping’) Innovate UK will consider terminating the project, recovering all project costs and where there is evidence of dishonesty (Fraud Act 2006), referring the matter to the Police.

                        <li>Innovate UK provide grant funding to your project with the expectation that additional investment (co-investment) will be needed to see the innovation through to commercialisation.  This could include:

                            Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) will be monitored during the Project and its evaluation. This will require (and is not limited to) sharing of staff EDI data when requested (to the extent you are able to lawfully process such staff data) and monitoring and reporting on EDI impacts in line with the Equality Act 2010.
                            All personal data provided to Innovate UK will be processed in accordance with current UK data protection legislation, including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

                    Unless otherwise stated in the GOL, Innovate UK makes the award through its Research, Development and Innovation Scheme operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)) and subsequent amendment.
                    You must ensure at all times that you are compliant with the State Aid Rules under which you have been awarded. Further information about the State Aid Rules can be found in the section on State Aid in Innovate UK’s general guidance for applicants.

                    You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this award of grant.

                <li>Innovate UK will immediately stop grant payments to you in any and all projects if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous European Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received as illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</li>
