                                  a wholly-owned subsidiary of UK Research and Innovation (‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’). These general terms and conditions apply to requests to fund the project named in the loan
                funding application and are confirmed in the loan agreement and security documentation that will be entered into if your application for an innovation loan is successful.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Entering into a loan agreement with us is a significant financial commitment. In applying, you must:</p>

                <li>understand that information provided by you in the application will form part of the loan agreement. Information later proven to be false or misleading may lead to a breach of the loan agreement which could result in the immediate withdrawal of the loan, a demand for immediate repayment and the enforcement of any security granted in connection with the loan agreement</li>
                <li>acknowledge that the execution of the loan agreement and all associated documents must be by an authorised signatory of the company and evidence of such authorisation must be provided in the form of a board resolution</li>

                        <li>Delivery of security documents</li>
                        <li>Completion of “Know Your Customer” and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, for all directors and/or persons of significant control</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>Security
                    <p class="govuk-body">Typical security for a transaction of this nature can include, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                        <li>a debenture over the assets of your business (including, and without limitation, a fixed charge over key assets and a floating charge over all the other assets of your business)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Where other funders are involved in a package deal, or future commercial investment is subject to securing priority, intercreditor arrangements may be required. In this event priority over assets not specifically scheduled in support of the innovation loan will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">We will not take personal guarantees or security over principal private residences or benefit from the future sale thereof in the event of a realisation.</p>

                <li>Loan covenants
                    <p class="govuk-body">The covenants set on each loan will depend on the structure of the transaction and the nature of the project. It is important to note that these covenants will consider the overall viability of your business. They will be relevant to the proper management of public funds but should not prevent you from delivering your planned activity.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">We expect your project to meet its scheduled delivery timetable with the support of the monitoring officer.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, covenants will include, at least:</p>

                                <li>right of approval on change of control or business sale</li>
                                <li>requirement to maintain prescribed debt service cover, liquidity, leverage and/or current assets ratios</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>reporting covenants
                            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Where the delivery of the project, its subsequent commercialisation and the overall viability of your business relies on the quality of the project, the business leadership team and the individuals within it, the lender may require ‘key person’ clauses in addition to the items above.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Events of default
                    <p class="govuk-body">The events of default will depend on the structure of the transaction and the nature of the project. The events of default will be market standard and will include at least the following:</p>
