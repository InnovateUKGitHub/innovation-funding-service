                                <li>Payments of your grant by Innovate UK will only begin when you have returned the signed grant offer letter.

Please note that before your final claim, You must provide evidence to us of any payments you have received as other types of government funding, including but not limited to the Coronavirus job retention scheme (furlough) payments. Where there is evidence of such payments, Innovate UK reserves the right to reclaim its own grant payments.

                                <li>Innovate UK has the right not to consider new grant applications from organisations who have failed to return required documentation, including financial reports, on any previous projects funded by Innovate UK or have breached the Terms & Conditions of any other award from UKRI. </li>
                                <li>You are responsible for maintaining contemporaneous and detailed records and documentation relating to the use of your grant, including timesheets, invoices and other documents. The time recording system should clearly show when, who and what has been carried out by employees. These should provide sufficient evidence to support the submission of timely and accurate claims and to demonstrate that your eligible project costs comply with all state aid rules, as outlined in paragraph 11. These records must be kept for 10 years following your receipt of the grant and must be supplied to satisfy European Commission requests for evidence of compliance within 20 days if requested. Grant recipients should be open and transparent and must provide additional information if asked. For example, this may include details of staff contributing to the project, or the nature of the relationship between directors of companies involved in the project. </li>
                                <li>Where you use subcontractors, we reserve the right to request further information and conduct further checks.

A project partner cannot provide services or equipment to other project partners at a profit. </li>

                                    Payment of the retained value (10%) is subject to the contents of the final accountant’s report. Adjustments may mean that you are not entitled to receive all of the retained value.
