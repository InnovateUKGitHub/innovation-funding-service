You must ensure at all times that you are compliant with the State Aid regulations under which you have been awarded. Further information about the regulations can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovate-uk-funding-general-guidance-for-applicants#state-aid" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">section on State Aid</a> in Innovate UK’s general guidance for applicants.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this offer. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding you are receiving for a project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER. You must ensure you comply with State Aid rules, which are those rules contained in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/provisions.html" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Articles 107 to 109 of Section 2, Title VII, of the Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws</a>, Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2008/C 115/01).</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will immediately stop grant payments to you in any and all projects if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful state aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of state aid obligations.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You acknowledge that in compliance with EU Treaty obligations, Innovate UK may be required to provide the European Commission with information about the financial assistance given to it by Innovate UK and shall provide such assistance as Innovate UK shall reasonably request.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">11. Intellectual property</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">For a period of 5 years from the end of the project, Innovate UK expects you to take reasonable steps to exploit the results of the project in the UK or wider European Economic Area</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You must refine and update your exploitation plan, initially set out in your application, throughout the lifetime of the project and where specified for a defined period after the project end date.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">For a period of 5 years from the end of the project, Innovate UK will continuously evaluate the impact of funding awarded to the project and you will cooperate fully in this process and may make additional reporting requests both during and post project. It is the responsibility of the project and its participants that reporting requirements are completed fully and accurately within confirmed timescales.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">13. Collection of economic data</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You will provide annual records of the realised and expected economic outputs that have arisen because of the project, following the specific requirements provided as part of the request. You will provide these for the life of the project and where requested, for up to 5 years after the project has completed.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This information will be shared with the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and the APC to help evaluate the value for money of the APC programme as a whole.</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>either, unilaterally to terminate the grant and potentially to seek repayment of all or part of the grant funds previously paid to you; or</li>
                <li>the parties agree to refer the matter to the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), whose decision will be binding. Any arbitration will be conducted in accordance with LCIA Arbitration Rules before one arbitrator seated in London</li>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">17. Force majeure</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">When Innovate UK’s ability to continue funding your project is affected by an event of force majeure, or a change to the laws of England and Wales, UK government or devolved administration policy, or the Legal Acts of the European Union, we may terminate the grant by giving you as much notice as possible in writing. In such circumstances, Innovate UK will meet any eligible costs you have reasonably incurred and paid prior to the date of termination.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">18. Managing public funds</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">This is an absolute condition of the award of your grant.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">20. Entire agreement</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">By submitting an application you are accepting that any grant which may be offered will be governed by these terms and conditions.

This agreement constitutes the whole agreement between Innovate UK and supersedes all previous agreements between us relating to the project. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into this agreement, it has not relied on and has no right or remedy in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently) other than as expressly set out in this agreement.

            <p class="govuk-body">This fee will be invoiced by APC, on a quarterly basis, to each project partner in line with submission of claims to Innovate UK.
