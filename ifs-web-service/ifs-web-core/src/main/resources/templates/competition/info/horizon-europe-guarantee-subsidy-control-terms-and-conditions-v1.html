                                <li>The progress of the Project will be monitored by UKRI through the Monitoring Officer. The Monitoring Officer is the Recipient’s first point of contact for official notifications, queries and correspondence with UKRI, unless otherwise required by the Grant Offer Letter. The Recipient must comply with any requests for information and deadlines from the Monitoring Officer.</li>
                                <li>The Recipient’s project manager, and others as may be agreed from time to time, will meet with the Monitoring Officer once a Quarter (or other agreed period) to review the Recipient’s written progress report for the period since the last monitoring meeting.

                                <li>The Monitoring Officer will require the Recipient to provide satisfactory evidence of project delivery in the following three aspects:

                                <li>At the end of the Project, the Recipient will be required to supply UKRI with the following:

                                <li>The Recipient must, for a period of ten years after payment of the final instalment of the Grant, retain records and other supporting documentation. This is in order to prove compliance with the terms of this Grant Offer Letter, in particular that the costs it declares are Eligible Costs. The Recipient must maintain records and other supporting documentation in accordance with its obligations under the HE Agreement or Consortium Agreement.</li>

                                <li>The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that UKRI only makes payments of the Grant in accordance with this Grant Offer Letter on a benevolent basis to assist the Recipient to deliver the Project.</li>
                                <li>Subject to the remainder of this clause 5, UKRI will reimburse the Recipient up to the amount of the Grant for the Eligible Costs of the Project.</li>
                                <li>UKRI shall be permitted to change the GBP (£) value of the Grant where in UKRI’s opinion there is a significant fluctuation in the GBP:EUR exchange rate from the exchange rate previously used to calculate the GBP (£) value of the outstanding Grant sum provided always that:
                                    <p>(a) the GBP value of the Grant shall not change more than once in any 12-month period; and</p>
                                    <p>(b) the revaluation process shall not affect payments which have already been made to the Recipient.</p>

                                <li>UKRI will pay the Grant in instalments quarterly in arrears following submission of a claim, unless otherwise agreed between UKRI and the Recipient in writing.</li>
                                <li>All claims will be submitted and payments will be made in GBP (£). The Recipient shall not be entitled to make any claim for funding which would cause the total amounts claimed under the Grant Offer Letter to exceed the value of the Grant.</li>
                                <li><strong>The</strong> Recipient's claims must be supported by:
                                    <p>(a) a current forecast as at the claim date of the Eligible Costs to the end of the Project, detailing the expected costs for each future claim period, highlighting any significant variations from the last forecast. Any variance greater than 20% between the original forecast and actual expenditure for each forecast interval may be subject to review and may affect the eligibility of the claim value;</p>
                                    <p>(b) confirmation that the Recipient has incurred and defrayed the Eligible Costs in respect of which claims have been made. For this purpose, an Independent Accountant’s Report must be provided by a qualified independent accountant of the Recipient (the “<strong>Independent Accountant</strong>”) to UKRI at the intervals detailed below (unless as otherwise notified to the Recipient by UKRI). The Independent Accountant must be appointed by the Recipient in accordance with the template terms of engagement provided by UKRI to the Recipient. All costs must be supported by an Independent Accountant’s Report, and any uncertified costs will be ineligible for grant;
                                        For the avoidance of doubt UKRI may at its sole discretion increase the Grant in the event additional cost claims are necessary and associated solely to the Independent Accountant’s Report. Any increase of the Grant will be subject to a cap of 5% of the total Grant.</p>
