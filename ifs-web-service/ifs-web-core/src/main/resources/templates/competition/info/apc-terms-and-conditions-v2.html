            <li>These terms and conditions, together with Innovate UK’s policies and guidance notes apply to all organisations applying for grant funding. This is either individually or in collaboration. Each organisation must accept these terms and conditions before submitting an application.</li>
            <li>Whilst this is an Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) UK competition, Innovate UK is the funding body and any grant which is awarded will be payable by Innovate UK subject to these terms and conditions. The role of APC, the services it provides and the related responsibilities of project participants are described in Schedule 1 at the end of these terms and conditions.</li>
            <li>Whether a grant is awarded depends upon whether you are successful in the APC competition. If successful, the lead organisation receives a grant offer letter confirming any project-specific conditions of the grant. This letter must be countersigned and uploaded by the lead organisation as detailed in the application, before the project can start. Neither Innovate UK nor APC have any obligations under these terms and conditions including Schedule 1 unless or until the lead organisation signs and uploads the grant offer letter in the correct manner.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. General terms and conditions</h2>

        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Claims must be for completed quarters only, except for the final quarter where you can submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK has the right not to consider new applications from organisations who have failed to return required financial reports on any projects funded by Innovate UK.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will not pay more than 85&percnt; of the grant until all outstanding claims and supporting information have been received and the final Independent Accountant’s Report has been approved.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You are responsible for maintaining detailed records and documentation relating to your grant. These should provide evidence that your eligible project costs comply with all State aid rules, as outlined in section 9. These records must be kept for 10 years following the grant and must be supplied as requested within 20 days.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may appoint an auditor to ensure you are complying with all terms and conditions. You agree to give the auditor access to your project records within 2 weeks of notice of their appointment. If the auditor determines that you should repay the grant to Innovate UK, Innovate UK may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">5. Monitoring</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your project will be monitored in accordance with Innovate UK's project monitoring framework. You will meet with your assigned monitoring officer as often as is specified at the start of the project. You will allow them access to your employees, agents, premises, facilities and records to review your progress, and send them any information, explanations and documents requested within 10 days.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">6. Suspension, withdrawal and repayment of grant</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Failure to adhere to the terms of this grant may lead to Innovate UK suspending, withdrawing or reclaiming the grant in whole or in part.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If we have concerns that mean we might need to suspend, withdraw or reclaim the grant we will write to inform you and you will then have 30 days in which to address our concerns.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Examples of events that may result in Innovate UK suspending grant payments include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>misuse of the grant funds, including in a fraudulent or financially misleading way (or for purposes not related to the project)</li>

            <li>a breach of State aid rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Examples of events that may result in Innovate UK stopping grant payments include:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where an event of force majeure, or a change to the laws of England and Wales, UK government or devolved administration policy and/or the Legal Acts of the European Union occurs which affects Innovate UK’s ability to continue funding your project, we can terminate the grant by giving you as much notice as possible in writing. In such circumstances, Innovate UK will meet its obligations to pay grant against any eligible costs you have reasonably incurred and paid before the date of termination.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">7. Financial reporting</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You agree to appoint an Independent Accountant who will inspect your financial statements relating to the grant.

        <p class="govuk-body">You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this offer. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding you are receiving for a project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will stop grant payments if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any award to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful State Aid, interest will be charged. This is on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of State Aid obligations.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">10. Intellectual property</h2>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">13. Dispute resolution</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Where a dispute arises between you and Innovate UK, we would advise your Chief Executive Officer to contact us to discuss, in good faith, how the matter can be resolved. If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be found, the parties agree to refer the matter to the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), whose decision will be binding.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">14. Fee for APC Services</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You and each project partner (including Academic and RTO partners) will be required to pay a fee to APC for the services it provides, as outlined in Schedule 1.

Unless otherwise agreed between APC and a project partner, project partners are expected to pay the fee within 30 days of the invoice date.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">For the avoidance of doubt, APC is VAT registered in the United Kingdom, and will charge VAT, where applicable, at the prevailing rate.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Publication of Information</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK and APC publicise the results of competitions and applications.

        <p class="govuk-body">The participants are actively encouraged to seek their own publicity. APC (and, in exceptional circumstances and at all times in coordination with APC, Innovate UK) can however, have specific requirements with regards to the timing of communication activities. For instance this could be occasions when a government announcement is due to take place involving a specific competition or project. If this happens, APC (or, in exceptional circumstances and at all times in coordination with APC, Innovate UK) will contact the participants to request its publicity is aligned with the government announcement and that the participants defer any publicity until an agreed date.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Should the participants wish to publicise the project (including by way of industrial events, direct public engagement or via media outlets) it is requested that the participants advise APC in advance, where possible.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4. Annual review</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your project is subject to an annual review. This is in addition to the Quarterly Review Meetings (referred to in the Innovate UK project-monitoring framework).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You are required to present an updated strategic rationale for the project to representatives of the APC and BEIS and Innovate UK.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The purpose of the review is to understand how changes in business environments have altered:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the strategic alignment of the project partners with the outputs of the project</li>
            <li>the commercial viability of the technologies and other outputs developed through the project</li>
            <li>the commitment of the project partners to finance the next stages of the project and the ensuing commercialisation of technologies developed through the project</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">The review meetings are held within 3 months of each anniversary of the project start date.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">APC will agree the date, content and structure of the review with the lead organisation in advance.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The outcome of the annual review may result in further items for attention or issues that require resolution. Following the annual review and where appropriate, the Innovate UK Monitoring Officer will follow the monitoring officer guidelines and take appropriate action.</p>
