                                    Innovate UK will not make payment for project costs that you are already in receipt of, whether from Innovate UK (in a separate project award) or any other funding organisation.
                                    <p>In the event that separate funding has been awarded for costs associated with the same project deliverables it is the responsibility of you, to notify Innovate UK and any other funding organisation. This will allow the awarding organisations to agree who should fund the relevant costs.</p>
                                    <p>If you are found to be claiming duplicate project costs whilst in receipt of separate funding (‘double dipping’) Innovate UK will consider terminating the project. Innovate UK will then recover all project costs and where there is evidence of dishonesty (Fraud Act 2006), referring the matter to the Police.</p>
