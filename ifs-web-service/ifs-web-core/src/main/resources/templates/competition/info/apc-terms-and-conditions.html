        <p class="govuk-body">These terms and conditions apply to organisations that are applying for grant funding either individually or in
            collaboration with others. This is an Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) UK competition and your relationship with
            the APC is set out in Schedule 1.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">By submitting an application you accept the terms in paragraph 1 (general terms and conditions) and paragraph 8
            (confidentiality and information management).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are successful, the lead applicant will receive a grant offer letter confirming any project-specific
            conditions of the grant. The lead applicant or a member of the lead organisation must countersign and upload the
            letter in the correct manner before the project can start.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The full terms and conditions, including Schedule 1, become effective when you sign your grant offer letter.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. General terms and conditions</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK reserves the right to change these grant terms and conditions unilaterally and at any time by giving 3 months&#39; notice.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You cannot assign, transfer or sub-contract any of your rights or obligations under this agreement to any third party.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Rights and remedies under this grant, whether exercised or not, remain available throughout the life of the award.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An award does not create any partnership or joint venture under the laws of England and Wales.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>accepts no liability for any consequences, whether direct or indirect, that may come about by undertaking
                the project, using the grant, or ending the award</li>
            <li>limits its liability to the amount of eligible award that can be evidenced</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">These terms and conditions and awards are subject to the laws of England and Wales.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An award cannot be used for any political or lobbying activity or purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Duration</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The full terms and conditions come into effect from the start date as set out in your grant offer letter until
            the end date provided in the grant offer letter, or until the award is terminated.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Your obligations</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">As a successful applicant, you will:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>make sure that the project is managed in accordance with the project proposal and these terms and conditions</li>
            <li>inform Innovate UK promptly, through your monitoring officer (MO), of any issue or material change that may
                affect the progress, delivery or exploitation of the project</li>
            <li>within 3 months of the end of the project, provide the MO with the final project report and confirmation
                that the final claim and final independent accountant&#39;s report have been submitted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">4. Payment of grant</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will pay your grant by instalments quarterly and in arrears on submission of a claim, unless
            otherwise agreed in your grant offer letter. This will be against your net eligible costs incurred and paid over
            the duration of the project.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your claims must be supported by:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a revised forecast of eligible project costs which details expected costs for each future claim period and
                highlights any variations from the last forecast</li>
            <li>an independent accountant&#39;s report (see paragraph 7)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will normally pay the grant within 30 days, unless we need further information to support the claim.
            We agree to pay within 14 days of receiving the further information.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it
            relates. We will not pay any claims received later than 3 months after completion of the project.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK reserves the right not to consider new applications from organisations who have failed to return the
            required financial reports on any projects funded by Innovate UK.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will not pay more than 85% of the grant until all outstanding claims and supporting information have
            been received and the final independent accountant&#39;s report has been approved.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You are responsible for maintaining detailed records and documentation relating to your award. These should
            provide evidence that your eligible project costs comply with all State aid rules, as outlined in paragraph 9.
            These records must be kept for 10 years following the award and must be supplied to the European Commission
            within 20 days if requested.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may appoint an auditor to ensure you are complying with these terms and conditions. You agree to
            give the auditor access to your project records within 2 weeks of notice of their appointment. If the auditor
            determines that you should repay the grant to Innovate UK, Innovate UK may recover the cost of the auditor&#39;s
            work from you.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">5. Monitoring</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your project will be monitored in accordance with Innovate UK&#39;s project monitoring framework. You will meet with
            your assigned monitoring officer as often as is agreed at the start of the project. You will allow them access
            to your employees, agents, premises, facilities and records to review your progress, and send them any
            information, explanations and documents requested within 10 days.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">6. Suspension, withdrawal and repayment of grant</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may suspend, withdraw or reclaim the grant either in whole or in part. We will aim to minimise the
            impact on delivery of the project. You agree that if this happens, Innovate UK may inform other government or
            anti-fraud agencies.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may suspend grant payments for any reason Innovate UK considers reasonable. If this happens, we will
            serve you with a written notice specifying the breach and requiring you to remedy the issue within 30 days.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Examples of events that may result in suspension include:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>misuse of the grant funds, including in a fraudulent or financially irregular way (as described in
                paragraph 7) or for purposes not related to the project</li>
            <li>false statements on how you will use the grant made as part of the application process, or false statements
                on your use of grant or in your claims made for grant</li>
            <li>failure to maintain satisfactory progress on the project or to meet your delivery plan</li>
            <li>a suspected conflict of interest or a suspected breach of Innovate UK&#39;s conflict of interest policy</li>
            <li>suspected overpayment of grant by Innovate UK</li>
            <li>any material changes to the proposed outcomes of the project</li>
            <li>a breach of the confidentiality provisions in paragraph 8</li>
            <li>a breach of State aid rules in paragraph 9</li>
            <li>your failure to comply with these terms and conditions, including not complying with Innovate UK policies
                that are in force for the duration of the project, such as those on anti-bribery and data protection</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may immediately and permanently withdraw all future grant payments without any prior requirement to
            suspend the grant in the event that:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you are found, to Innovate UK&#39;s satisfaction, to have misused grant funds or made false statements</li>
            <li>you fail to resolve to Innovate UK&#39;s satisfaction, or it is not possible to resolve, the reasons for suspension</li>
            <li>you are found to have committed an offence under the Bribery Act 2010</li>
            <li>you are found to have breached Innovate UK&#39;s policies relating to anti-bribery, data protection or conflict
                of interest</li>
            <li>you become insolvent, are declared bankrupt, are placed into receivership, administration or liquidation,
                or a petition has been presented for winding up, or any similar arrangements that may affect you financially</li>
            <li>your legal status changes, including a change of control</li>
            <li>you are found to have breached the State aid rules in paragraph 9</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not resolve the reason for suspension of the award to Innovate UK&#39;s satisfaction, or if we permanently
            withdraw the award, we may require you to repay some or all payments made to you under the award of grant. This
            does not include any withdrawal for force majeure, where paragraph 16 will apply.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">7. Financial reporting</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You agree to appoint an independent accountant using Innovate UK&#39;s standard letter of engagement template. The
            independent accountant will, at your expense, inspect your financial statements relating to the grant. They will
            prepare an independent accountant&#39;s report at the intervals stated in the relevant guidance note from the letter
            template. The report will contain an opinion that:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the financial information and level of grant claimed are accurate and legitimate</li>
            <li>eligible costs that you have submitted have been properly incurred and paid</li>
            <li>you have provided satisfactory explanations for any queries raised by the independent accountant</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must appoint an independent accountant in a manner consistent with Innovate UK&#39;s Standard Terms of
            Engagement of Accountants, which Innovate UK will send with the grant offer letter.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">In some circumstances, you may be asked to provide your latest published annual accounts or management accounts,
            as long as you do not breach any law, order or regulation restricting such disclosure.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK may also require you to submit an independent accountant&#39;s report if any of the following occur:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you withdraw from the project</li>
            <li>the project is terminated</li>
            <li>you submit a claim disclosing expenditure substantially greater than forecast</li>
            <li>you are suspected of breaching the terms and conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">8. Confidentiality and information management</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK reserves the right to request access to any additional information we deem necessary in connection
            with this award. You must provide or allow access to such information within 2 weeks of a request.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">9. State aid obligations</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK awards grant funding through its
            <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases/256732/256732_1703219_80_2.pdf" class="govuk-link">Research, Development and
            Innovation Scheme</a></p>

        <p class="govuk-body">operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (&quot;the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)&quot;).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs
            covered by this offer. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding you are
            receiving for a project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK will stop grant payments if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous
            Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received illegal and incompatible with the internal
            market.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to
            be unlawful State aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the
            applicable legislated rate.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">No subcontract may be made which would constitute a breach of State aid obligations.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">10. Intellectual property</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Any intellectual property rights (IPRs) developed during or as a result of the project are owned by you.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will ensure that you have the necessary rights to use or access third party IPR needed to carry out the project.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">11. Exploitation of project results</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK expects you to refine and update your exploitation plan over the project&#39;s lifetime.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">For a period of 5 years from the end of the project, Innovate UK expects you to take reasonable steps to exploit
            the results of the project in the UK or wider European Economic Area.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">12. Collection of economic data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">For the life of the project, you will provide annual records of the realised and expected economic outputs that
            have arisen because of the project. You will provide this data where requested, for up to 5 years after the
            project has completed.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This information will be shared with the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and the APC to
            help evaluate the value for money of the APC programme as a whole.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">13. UK statutory framework</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK is subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Data Protection Act 1998,
            as detailed on our corporate website.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">14. Publication of information</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK encourages you to seek your own publicity and to discuss this with the APC before publication.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">15. Dispute resolution</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where a dispute arises between you and Innovate UK, we would advise your chief executive officer to contact us
            to discuss, in good faith, how the matter can be resolved. If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be found,
            the parties agree to refer the matter to the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), whose decision
            will be binding.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">16. Force majeure</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">When Innovate UK&#39;s ability to continue funding your project is affected by an event of force majeure, or a
            change to the laws of England and Wales, UK government or devolved administration policy, or the Legal Acts of
            the European Union, we may terminate the grant by giving you as much notice as possible in writing. In such
            circumstances, Innovate UK will meet any eligible costs you have reasonably incurred and paid prior to the date
            of termination.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">17. Transfer to UK Research and Innovation </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The property, rights and liabilities of Innovate UK will be acquired by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in
            accordance with the Higher Education and Research Act 2017. Once the UKRI Property Transfer Scheme becomes
            effective, all of Innovate UK&#39;s rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities related to your application and
            for the award and monitoring of any grant will move to UKRI. You will take any reasonable actions we request to
            make this possible.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">18. Managing public funds</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will comply with:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee</li>
            <li>any other government controls on using public funding</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">19. Special conditions</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will be required to pay the APC for the services it provides, as outlined in Schedule 1, by the payment of a
            fee by every project partner. The fee will be calculated as 3.5% of the value of each project partner&#39;s portion
            of the grant. Academic partners are also required to pay this fee.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This is an absolute condition of the award of your grant.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">20. Entire agreement</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">By submitting an application you are accepting that any grant which may be offered will be governed by these
            terms and conditions. These terms and, if applicable, your grant offer letter, once signed, are the entire
            agreement between us.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Schedule 1 <br />Your relationship with the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">This schedule provides an overview of the relationship and requirements between you and the Advanced Propulsion
            Centre (APC) UK on the award of any grant.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Support from APC and payments to APC</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">APC will work with you to give support:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>during the application, project monitoring and close out phases</li>
            <li>with industry engagement events for the project team</li>
            <li>in reporting overall progress to the Automotive Council UK and BEIS</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">APC will be remunerated for the services it provides, as outlined in paragraph 19 of the Innovate UK terms and
            conditions of an Advanced Propulsion Centre UK competition grant award. Academic partners are not exempt from
            this requirement.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This fee will be invoiced by APC, on a quarterly basis, to each project partner in line with submission of
            claims to Innovate UK. Unless otherwise agreed between APC and a project partner, project partners are expected
            to pay the fee within 30 days of the invoice date.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">For the avoidance of doubt, APC is VAT registered in the United Kingdom, and will charge VAT, where applicable,
            at the prevailing rate.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Under the terms of the agreement between you and the APC, the lead applicant shall provide the APC with a copy
            of the Core Projects Publication Request and Asset Release Form. This will be supplied to the lead applicant as
            part of the project set-up phase. The return of the form is an absolute condition of the award of your grant.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Any information provided by a project partner in this form, including any commercially sensitive information,
            will become publicly accessible.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Annual project review</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your project will be subject to an annual review. You will be required to present an updated strategic rationale
            for the project to the APC.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The purpose of the review is to understand how changes in business environments have altered:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the strategic alignment of the project partners with the outputs of the project</li>
            <li>the commercial viability of the technologies and other outputs developed through the project</li>
            <li>the commitment of the project partners to finance the next stages of the project and the ensuing
                commercialisation of technologies developed through the project</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The review meetings will be held within 3 months of each anniversary of the project start date. These dates will
            be set by the APC in consultation with you.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">APC will agree the content and structure of the review with you in advance, and in consultation with Innovate UK.</p>
