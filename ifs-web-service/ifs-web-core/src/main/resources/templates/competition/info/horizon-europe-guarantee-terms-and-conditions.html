                                        <li>4.4	Failure to provide satisfactory evidence in any one of these areas will prevent the Monitoring Officer from validating the Recipient’s claims for Grant.</li>

                                            <p>(b)	the revaluation process shall not affect payments which have already been made to the Recipient. </p>

                                        <li>5.4	UKRI will pay the Grant in instalments quarterly in arrears following submission of a claim, unless otherwise agreed between UKRI and the Recipient in writing.</li>
                                        <li>5.5	All claims will be submitted and payments will be made in GBP (£). The Recipient shall not be entitled to make any claim for funding which would cause the total amounts claimed under this Grant Offer Letter to exceed the value of the Grant.</li>
                                        <li>5.6	The Recipient's claims must be supported by:
                                            <p>(a)	a current forecast as at the claim date of the Eligible Costs to the end of the Project, detailing the expected costs for each future claim period, highlighting any significant variations from the last forecast. Any variance greater than 20% between the original forecast and actual expenditure for each forecast interval may be subject to review and may affect the eligibility of the claim value; </p>
                                            <p>(b)	confirmation that the Recipient has incurred and defrayed the Eligible Costs in respect of which claims have been made.
