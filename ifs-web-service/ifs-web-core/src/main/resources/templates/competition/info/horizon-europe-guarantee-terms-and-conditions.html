                                <li>4.1	The progress of the Project will be monitored by UKRI through the Monitoring Officer.

                                <li>4.4	Failure to provide satisfactory evidence in any one of these areas will prevent the Monitoring Officer from validating the Recipient’s claims for Grant.</li>
                                <li>4.5	UKRI shall be entitled to inspect any financial or other records and procedures associated with the Grant as are reasonably required to verify the regularity and propriety of Grant expenditure (including expenditure by Third Parties), or to appoint any other body or individual for the purpose of such inspection.

                                    <p>(a)	a current forecast as at the claim date of the Eligible Costs to the end of the Project, detailing the expected costs for each future claim period, highlighting any significant variations from the last forecast. Any variance greater than 20% between the original forecast and actual expenditure for each forecast interval may be subject to review and may affect the eligibility of the claim value; </p>
                                    <p>(b)	confirmation that the Recipient has incurred and defrayed the Eligible Costs in respect of which claims have been made. For this purpose, an Independent Accountant’s Report must be provided by a qualified independent accountant of the Recipient (the “Independent Accountant”) to UKRI at the intervals notified to the Recipient by UKRI. The Independent Accountant must be appointed by the Recipient in accordance with the template terms of engagement provided by UKRI to the Recipient. All costs must be supported by an Independent Accountant’s Report, and any uncertified costs will be ineligible for grant;</p>
                                    <p>(c)	if requested by UKRI, the latest published annual accounts or management accounts of the Recipient. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 5.7(c) shall require the Recipient to provide financial information in breach of any law, order or regulation restricting such disclosure; and</p>
                                    <p>(d)	In exceptional circumstances, UKRI may also require an Independent Accountant’s Report to be submitted before the final claim. Such exceptional circumstances shall include without limitation:

                                    <p>(f)	where UKRI needs to seek further information to support or understand the claim, UKRI agrees to contact the Recipient within 14 days of the claim being received. If UKRI deems any costs claimed to be ineligible and the Recipient disagrees with UKRI’s assessment, the Recipient must within 30 days of UKRI’s notice, notify UKRI of its disagreement and provide reasons and evidence why the costs are Eligible Costs. The final decision concerning eligibility rests with UKRI.</p>

If in UKRI’s opinion adjustments are required, UKRI is entitled not to pay the full amount of the final claim and the retained Grant value.
