                <li>Innovate UK will immediately stop grant payments to you in any and all projects if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</li>
                <li>Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful state aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</li>
