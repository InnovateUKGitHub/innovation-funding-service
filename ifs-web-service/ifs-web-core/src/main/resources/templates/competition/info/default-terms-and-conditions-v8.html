                                    You are required to have a time recording arrangement which allows you to accurately record time charged to Innovate UK projects. All labour claims must be supported by a time recording arrangement which includes:

                                    Claims must be for completed quarters only. The exception is the final quarter which is the only occasion when you can submit a claim for costs incurred but not necessarily paid, provided that the cost is:

                                <li>Innovate UK will normally pay the grant within 30 days unless we need further information to support the claim. We agree to raise requests for further information, if any, within 14 days of receiving the claim.</li>
                                <li>All claims must be submitted or completed as draft within 30 days of the period end. Innovate UK does not have to pay any claim received more than 30 days after the end of the quarter to which it relates.</li>

                                <li>We will not pay the final claim or the 10% retained value if the items listed above are received later than 3 months after project completion date. Payment of the retained value (10%) is subject to the contents of the final IAR Adjustments may mean that you are not entitled to receive all of the retained value.</li>
                                <li>You are responsible for maintaining contemporaneous and detailed records and documentation relating to the use of your grant, including timesheets, invoices and other documents.</li>
                                <li>The time recording system should clearly show when, who and what has been carried out by employees. These should provide sufficient evidence to support the submission of timely and accurate claims and to demonstrate that your eligible project costs comply with the UK Subsidy Control Framework or State Aid Rules (as applicable) and as outlined in section 16.</li>
                                <li>These records must be kept for 10 years following your receipt of the grant and must be supplied to satisfy requests for evidence of compliance within 20 days if requested.
                                    <p>Grant recipients should be open and transparent and must provide additional information if asked. For example, this may include details of staff contributing to the project, or the nature of the relationship between the consortium members.</p></li>
                                <li>Where you use subcontractors, we reserve the right to request further information and conduct further checks. Any relationship between the funded project partner and subcontractor must be declared.
                                    <p>The lead project partner must be able to demonstrate that value for money is obtained in the procurement of goods, services or works funded by the grant. The procurement process must reflect that which a participant would typically use concerning its own money, with equal, or greater, vigilance. A project partner cannot sell services or equipment to other project partners at a profit.</p></li>
                                <li>Innovate UK may appoint an auditor, at our expense, to ensure you are complying with the terms and conditions of this agreement. You agree to give the auditor or person nominated by UKRI, access to your project records within 2 weeks’ notice of their appointment.
                                    <p>If the auditor determines that all or part of the grant has been misapplied or that you should repay all or part of the grant to Innovate UK, we may recover the cost of the auditor’s work from you.</p></li>
                                <li>Innovate UK will not make payment for project costs that you are already in receipt of, whether from Innovate UK (in a separate project award) or any other funding organisation.
                                    <p>In the event that separate funding has been awarded for costs associated with the same project deliverables it is the responsibility of you to notify Innovate UK and any other funding organisation. This will allow the awarding organisations to agree who should fund the relevant costs.</p>
                                    <p>If you are found to be claiming duplicate project costs whilst in receipt of separate funding (double dipping), Innovate UK will consider terminating the project, recovering all project costs and where there is evidence of dishonesty (Fraud Act 2006), referring the matter to the Police.</p></li>

                        <li>The provisions of this Annex A only apply where the grant funding awarded falls within the scope of clause 16.1.</li>
                        <li>Unless otherwise stated in the GOL, Innovate UK makes the award through its Research, Development and Innovation Scheme operating under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)) and subsequent amendment.
                            <p>You must ensure at all times that you are compliant with the State aid rules under which you have been awarded. Further information about the state aid rules can be found in the section on state aid in Innovate UK’s general guidance for applicants.</p></li>
                        <li>You must inform Innovate UK of any other public funding applied for or awarded against the eligible costs covered by this award of grant. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cumulative total of public funding and aid intensity you are receiving for the project does not exceed those limits stated in GBER.
                            <p>You must ensure you comply with State Aid Rules, which are those rules contained in Articles 107 to 109 of Section 2, Title VII, of the common rules on competition, taxation and approximation of laws, consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and the treaty on the functioning of the European Union (2008/C 115/01).</p></li>
                        <li>Innovate UK will immediately stop grant payments to you in any and all projects if you become subject to a recovery order that follows on from a previous European Commission decision, which declares any aid you have received as illegal and incompatible with the internal market.</li>
                        <li>Where you are required by an order of the European Commission to repay any grant to Innovate UK that is found to be unlawful State Aid, interest will be charged on the amount being reclaimed from the date of payment at the applicable legislated rate.</li>
                        <li>No subcontract or other agreement with a third party can be made which would constitute a breach of your obligations under the State Aid Rules.</li>
                        <li>You acknowledge that Innovate UK may be required to provide the European Commission with information about the financial assistance given to you by Innovate UK and you agree to provide such assistance as Innovate UK shall reasonably request.</li>
