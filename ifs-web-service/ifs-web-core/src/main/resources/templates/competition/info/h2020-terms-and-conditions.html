                </li>
                <li>If you are successful, you will receive a grant offer letter confirming the conditions of the
                    award. This letter must be countersigned and uploaded by your organisation according to our

                    intend to replace these general terms and conditions with others tailored to the Programme. If the
                    grant offer letter sent to you contains, attaches or refers to alternative terms and conditions,
                    they will replace these terms and conditions. By countersigning and uploading the letter you will be
                    accepting the replacement terms and conditions sent with it.
                </li>
                <li>If you do not countersign and upload the letter, we may immediately terminate these terms and
                    conditions and require you to repay some or all grant payments made to you by us.
