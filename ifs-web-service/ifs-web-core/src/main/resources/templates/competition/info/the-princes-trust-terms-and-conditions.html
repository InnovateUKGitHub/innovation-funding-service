        <th:block th:fragment="terms-and-conditions-content">
        <p class="govuk-body">These terms and conditions apply to individuals who have applied for grant funding. You must accept these terms and conditions before you can begin to claim any of your grant.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Transfer to UK Research and Innovation</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">In April 2018 changes will be made to the structure of the UK's research and innovation bodies (including Innovate UK).  A new body corporate will be established under the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 that brings together the UK's 7 Research Councils, Innovate UK and a new organisation, Research England.  This new body will be known as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">With the establishment of UKRI, Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board) will cease to exist as a body corporate in its own right and will become a committee or 'Council' of UKRI. Innovate UK will continue to administer contract and grant funding and to manage the relationship with MSPs as a Council of UKRI. However, existing contracts awarded by Innovate UK under the DPS will be transferred to UKRI under a statutory transfer scheme and future contracts awarded under the DPS will be entered into by UKRI. More information is available from <a href="https://www.ukri.org/" class="govuk-link">the UKRI website</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">8. State Aid</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">These Young Innovator Awards are provided by Innovate UK on a ‘<em>de minimis</em>’ basis. This is a legal term by which the European Commission considers that public funding to a single recipient of up to €200,000 over a 3 year period has little or no impact on trade and competition, and does not require notification.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You must tell Innovate UK of any other public funding you have applied for or been awarded against the eligible costs covered by this offer. It is your responsibility to make sure that the total of public funding you are receiving at any one time for a project does not exceed the maximum amount of funding which is allowed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">No subcontract can be made which would constitute a breach of State Aid obligations.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">9. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Any intellectual property rights (IPRs) developed during or as a result of the project are owned by you.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will make sure that you have the necessary rights to use or access third party IPRs needed to carry out the project.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">10. Exploitation of project results</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK expects you to provide a summary project report at the end of the award that details activities carried out, deliverables and planned next steps.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">11. UK statutory framework</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK is subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Data Protection Act 1998, as detailed on our corporate website.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">12. Publication of information</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK encourages you to seek your own publicity. You can mention the support you have been given by using the words ‘supported by Innovate UK’. However it is important that you do not use Innovate UK’s logo in any of your literature without getting permission in writing from your Innovation Champion first. Please consult the Innovate UK guide ‘Publicising your project: guidelines from Innovate UK.’ This is available on request from Innovate UK’s Press Office: <a href="mailto:pressoffice@innovateuk.ukri.org" class="govuk-link">pressoffice@innovateuk.ukri.org</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">13. Issue resolution</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Although your Innovation Champion will be your first point of contact, you can contact Emily Nott: <a href="mailto:Emily.Nott@innovateuk.ukri.org" class="govuk-link">Emily.Nott@innovateuk.ukri.org</a> if you need to discuss a matter directly.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">14. Force majeure</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Where an event of force majeure (an unforeseen event that would prevent you from fulfilling your contract), or a change to the Laws of England and Wales, UK government or devolved administration policy and/or the Legal Acts of the European Union occurs which affects Innovate UK’s ability to continue funding your project, we can end the award by giving you as much notice as possible in writing. In such circumstances, Innovate UK will meet any eligible costs you have reasonably taken on, up to the new end date we have given you.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">15. Entire agreement</h2>
