                                <li>By submitting your application, you have agreed to become an Investor Partner in the Investor Partnerships Programme.</li>
                                <li>You will have the opportunity to offer investments to successful funding applicants in the Investor Partnerships Programme who have indicated interest in receiving investment from you. </li>
                                <li>You agree to provide us with contact information and a public description that we can share with interested funding applicants. </li>

                                <li>You will be required to lead aligned investment into the successful funding applicant. Aligned investment in funding applicants carrying out feasibility studies or industrial research projects must be at least the same amount as the Innovate UK grant award and equity investment in funding applicants carrying out experimental development projects must be at least twice the amount of the Innovate UK grant award. Your investment can be direct equity investment or convertible loans from either a single Investor Partner or a lead Investor Partner syndicating with other investors (from within or outside the Investor Partner pool).</li>
                                <li>You warrant that you (or a relevant member of your group) has access to sufficient funds to invest in successful funding applicants to the Investor Partnerships Programme. You will immediately notify us if you no longer have sufficient funds to invest in funding applicants or if you are unable to meet your obligations.</li>
                                <li>You are responsible for any decision you make to invest in a funding applicant and you will comply with your own due diligence, corporate governance and investment processes.</li>
                                <li>You will review funding applicants that have been identified by us to be suitable for a grant. Within 1 month of a funding applicant contacting you, you will:

                                    <p>(ii) notify all the funding applicants that have expressed an interest in investment from you, whether or not you would like to enter into detailed discussions with them in relation to investing in their business.</p>

                                <li>Within the timeframes specified by us and in accordance with the competition brief, if you (or a member of your group) wish to pursue an opportunity to invest in a funding applicant, you will:
                                    <p>(i)  notify us once you have reached heads of terms with a funding applicant and provide a summary of the proposed investment terms; and</p>

                                </li>

                                <li>Where you make an investment in a funding applicant, you must provide information on a quarterly basis following the commencement of the funding applicant’s project about any further investments into the funding applicant’s business, significant events concerning the growth of the business, any exit or listing of the business or of any business failure.</li>
                                <li>Following the completion of the funding applicant’s project, you will provide information to us relating to the progress and impact of the project and the business by completing an evaluation form to assist us in measuring the impact of the grant and investment.</li>
                                <li>You must ensure at all times that you act with reasonable skill and care that would be expected of an honest, fair, professional and reputable investor. Accordingly, you agree not to place undue pressure or coerce the funding applicants to agree to any detrimental terms in the investment agreement. </li>
