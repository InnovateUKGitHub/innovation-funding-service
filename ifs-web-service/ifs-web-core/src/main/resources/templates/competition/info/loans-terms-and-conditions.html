            <p class="govuk-body">The summary heads of terms are indicative and not exhaustive. The lender reserves the right to amend or withdraw these terms if required.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This is not an offer to provide finance.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Any loan agreement would be subject to due diligence and the documentation being in a form satisfactory to the lender:</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Staged drawdowns, quarterly in advance based on project milestones. Drawdowns will be subject to project progress, monitoring officer sign-off and financial and reporting covenants being met.</p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Where bespoke activities or arrangements are needed to complete a transaction, the lender reserves the right to pass on or share these costs, including the lender’s legal and valuation fees. This is subject to prior agreement with the borrower.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Interest
                    <p class="govuk-body">During the availability and extension periods, interest will be payable quarterly at 3.7% a year on amounts outstanding.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Repayment
                    <p class="govuk-body">The final repayment structure will be determined by the lender but could include:</p>
                    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                        <li>Interest-only period of up to 5 years, consisting of the agreed availability period and extension period and</li>
                        <li>Repayment period of up to 5 years by way of quarterly repayments including interest accrued and deferred during the availability and extension periods</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Pre-conditions
                    <p class="govuk-body">The pre-conditions will include at least:</p>
                    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                        <li>Evidence of the borrower's status as an eligible SME</li>
                        <li>Delivery of the borrower's business plan in a form that is satisfactory to the lender</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Security
                    <p class="govuk-body">Typical security for a transaction of this nature can include, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>a debenture over the borrower's assets (including, and without limitation, a fixed charge over key assets and a floating charge over all other assets of the borrower)</li>
                        <li>legal charges over intellectual property and specific assets financed under the loan agreement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="govuk-body">Where other funders are involved in a package deal, or future commercial investment is subject to securing priority, intercreditor arrangements may be required. In this event priority over assets not specifically scheduled in support of the innovation loan will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">The lender will not take personal guarantees or security over principal private residences or benefit from the future sale thereof in the event of a realisation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Loan covenants
                    <p class="govuk-body">The covenants set on each loan will depend on the structure of the transaction and the nature of the project. It is important to note that these covenants will consider the overall viability of the business of the borrower. They will be relevant to the proper management of public funds, but should not prevent the borrower from delivering their planned activity.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">The lender expects the project to meet its scheduled delivery timetable with the support of the monitoring officer.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For example, covenants will include, at least:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>affirmative covenants
                            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li>maintaining financial records and management information</li>
                                <li>compliance with UK tax obligations</li>
                                <li>maintenance of adequate insurance, including specific insurance in connection with the assets of the borrower and &lsquo;key person&rsquo; cover in case of the loss of an important member of the business</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>negative covenants
                            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li>control of “cash out”, dividends and/or withdrawal of directors’ loans.</li>
                                <li>right of approval on change of control or business sale</li>
                                <li>requirement to maintain prescribed debt service cover, liquidity, leverage and/or current assets ratios</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>reporting covenants
                            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li>annual accounts: audited as appropriate and as filed at Companies House and/or draft annual accounts, accountant-certified forecasts, regular management information, tax returns and bank statements</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Where the delivery of the project, its subsequent commercialisation and the overall viability of the business relies on the quality of the project, the business leadership team and the individuals within it, the lender may require ‘key person’ clauses in addition to the items above.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Events of default
                    <p class="govuk-body">The events of default will depend on the structure of the transaction and the nature of the project. The events of default will be market standard and will include at least the following:</p>
                    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                        <li>Change of control of the borrower without the lender’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.</li>
                        <li>The departure of a ‘key person’ from the business or the project without the lender’s prior agreement to the proposed and timely remedy, which will not be unreasonably withheld.</li>
                        <li>Non-payment on repayment date.</li>
                        <li>The borrower’s failure to comply with its obligations under the loan agreement.</li>
                        <li>Insolvency of the borrower.</li>
                        <li>Cross-default.</li>
                        <li>It is or becomes unlawful for any party to perform its obligations under the loan agreement.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="govuk-body">If the borrower defaults on its loan commitments, the lender will take steps to recover the debt in line with standard commercial practice.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Transferability and disclosure
                    <p class="govuk-body">The lender may freely transfer its rights under the loan agreement.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">The lender may disclose information applicable to such a transfer. The borrower shall reasonably assist with the provision of such information.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">The borrower may not assign or transfer its rights under the loan agreement.</p>
                </li>

                    <p class="govuk-body">The lender’s standard form loan agreement and security documentation will be used to document the transaction</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3.	Requirements and eligibility</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In your application form, confirm that the primary type of research that you will be doing in the project is experimental
                development and indicate the amount of loan you propose. This should be in line with the
                <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovation-loans-general-guidance-for-applicants#understanding-if-your-project-is-eligible-for-an-innovation-loan" target="_blank">general loan guidance for applicants</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Your application will be ineligible if:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>you have submitted the incorrect application form</li>
                <li>your submission does not include a completed finance form, is missing your finance forms or a completed startup high growth index survey</li>
                <li>any documents are not submitted in the correct file format as explained in this document</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4.	Competition process</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">For this competition, Innovate UK will use a portfolio approach. This is to make sure that the strategic criteria described in the competition brief are met for all projects considered to be above the quality threshold, and also to make sure that the portfolio of loans has a suitable credit quality. We will select the businesses to offer loans to, and the terms of those loans, building a portfolio that:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>has high quality projects</li>
                <li>has suitable credit quality</li>
                <li>addresses the range of themes as described in the scope for the competition set out in the competition brief</li>
                <li>represents the potential for return on investment for the company and the UK</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">Subject to meeting the innovation and credit quality thresholds, we reserve the right to manage the portfolio to achieve the correct balance of projects and funding.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Applications will have 2 parts:</p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Part A: application form and mandatory supporting documentation, covering the quality of the project and the suitability of the business to receive a loan. Part A of the application will enable us to assess how innovative the project is, using external, independent experts.</li>
                <li>Part B: the startup high growth index survey, developed by Early Metrics, will focus on the whole business and how suitable that business is for this loan opportunity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">Part A will be used for both the innovation and credit assessment.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Part B will only be used by those involved in the credit assessment, it will not affect the innovation score and will not be viewed by the assessors.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You should complete the startup high growth index survey for part B through the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VS78YDW" target="_blank">survey link</a> provided, including providing mandatory financial information.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Only businesses that are successful in both parts of the application will be offered an innovation loan. The final terms of any loan offer will be decided by the Innovate UK Loans Ltd credit committee.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">5.	Scope check</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Only applications that meet the eligibility criteria and scope of the competition will be sent for assessment. You will be notified if your application is not eligible for assessment or out of scope with a full explanation as to why. Innovate UK reserves the right to declare applications as ineligible or out of scope.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">6.	Assessment</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Once the scope and eligibility checks have been completed, part A of all eligible applications are sent for assessment</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The assessments are carried out as follows:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>part A of applications sent for assessment will be assessed by up to 5 external assessors who are experts in the innovation area identified in your application</li>
                <li>assessors will score part A of applications consistently and in line with scoring matrices. They will provide written feedback for each marked question</li>
                <li>applications will be ranked in descending order. Only applications which score over a quality threshold will be considered for detailed credit analysis and a possible loan offer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">7.	Initial credit evaluation</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Applications and the outputs from Early Metrics from the startup high growth index survey (part B) will be reviewed by our credit team. This is to identify whether the business is suitable to receive an innovation loan.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The evaluations are carried out as follows:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Early Metrics will use the responses to the startup high growth index survey to provide a report on each applicant to our credit team</li>
                <li>our credit team will review part A of applications, the startup high growth index survey reports from Early Metrics and other available financial information</li>
                <li>the credit team will consider whether propositions appear suitable, being:
                    <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>affordable: interest cover (in the drawdown and extension periods) and debt service cover (in the repayment period) should meet acceptable ranges</li>
                        <li>appropriate for debt finance: being close to market and achievable within the constraints of innovation loans and, if part of a wider project cost, the availability of capital to fund the project overall</li>
                        <li>supported by a credible management team: for example, whether the business benefits from professional financial advice and in-house commercial expertise or plans to secure these in the project period, alongside the technical skills to deliver the project to market</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>only applications which are recommended by our credit team will be considered for detailed credit analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">8.	Notification</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">We will notify you whether or not we will progress your application to detailed credit analysis by the date stated in the timeline, using the email address provided in the application form.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">9.	Detailed credit evaluation</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Those applications which score above a quality threshold and are recommended by our credit team will be progressed to detailed credit analysis. If, following detailed analysis, we wish to make you an offer of a loan, this will include the key terms and conditions of any such loan.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The detailed evaluations are carried out as follows:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>you will be informed if we need further information</li>
                <li>you will be given unique access to a secure file sharing site (co-ordinated by the lending operations team)</li>
                <li>the credit team will detail any additional information needed to complete the full credit assessment. We will try not to make multiple requests over an extended period of time. Applicants will also be asked for specific consents for credit reference agency checks to cover:
