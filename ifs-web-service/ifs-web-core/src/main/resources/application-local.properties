# Profile-specific application properties for use when the "local" profile is active. Properties here are considered before those in application.properties.
# The "local" profile is active on a developer build when built with Gradle (see the value of ext.activeProfile in dev-build.gradle and the value of spring.profiles.active in application.properties).
# Other environments run with an active "environment" profile and have a similar profile-specific file, application-environment.properties which exists on the classpath outside of the built artifact.
# The properties which reside here are anything that can or needs to change depending on the environment, notably base paths and secrets related to other systems.
