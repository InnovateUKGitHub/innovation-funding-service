/**
 * This class holds per-Thread a list of CompletableFutures generated from serving an HTTP request, and it is this
 * class' main responsibility to keep a track of CompletableFutures that have been generated from a thread of execution
 * and to allow the application to  wait for the completion of all of those Futures prior to continuing execution.
 *
 * CompletableFutures generated through {@link AsyncFuturesGenerator} async() and awaitAll() methods will be
 * auto-registered with this class.
 *
 * Starting with the main execution thread for handing an HttpServletRequest via a Controller method, any
 * CompletableFutures generated from this Thread will be registered here.  Any child Futures of these registered Futures
 * will also be registered here and the same for the children's' children's Futures etc.
 *
 * As the {@link Queue} holding all of these Futures was created in the main HttpServletRequest-handling Thread
 * and passed down to child Threads, child's child Threads etc for them to also register their generated futures in,
 * we are therefore able to await the completion of all Futures, child Futures etc back in the main
 * HttpServletRequest-handling Thread so that we can halt rendering of any templates from the Controllers until all
 * Futures have completed.
