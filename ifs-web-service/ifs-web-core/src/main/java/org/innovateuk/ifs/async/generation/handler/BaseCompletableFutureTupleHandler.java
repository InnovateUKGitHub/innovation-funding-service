/**
 * Base class for convenient handling of multiple CompletableFutures.
 *
 * The main benefit that these classes give is to allow the developer handle futures coding with a little nicer syntax.
 * For instance, rather than writing:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * CompletableFuture<Void> combination = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2);
 *
 * combination.thenApply(() -> {
 *
 *    F1 future1Result = future1.get();
 *    F2 future2Result = future2.get();
 *
 *    return doSomethingWith(future1Result, future2Result);
 * });
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * the developer can instead write:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * awaitAll(future1, future2).thenApply((future1Result, future2Result) ->
 *      doSomethingWith(future1Result, future2Result));
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * which is much more concise.
 *
 * The secondary benefit is that generating a CompletableFuture using these classes' thenAccept() or thenApply() methods
 * registers the newly generated CompletableFuture with AsyncFuturesHolder for the developer (which in turn prevents the
 * Controller from attempting to render any template until the registered CompletableFuture has fully completed).
 *
 * The third benefit is that generating a CompletableFuture using these classes' thenAccept() or thenApply() methods
 * will ensure that any descendant Futures spawned from these Futures and their children will be fully completed prior
 * to the next chained Future being executed, leading to more consistent behaviour (at the slight cost of slightly less
 * available parallelisation)

     * This method is the main implementation of awaitAll(future1, future2).thenApply((f1, f2) -> {... child future});
     *
     * In addition to creating "child future" and chaining it to execute after future1 and future2 have completed
     * (essentially out-of-the-box CompletableFuture.allOf(...).thenApply() functionality), this method additionally
     * enforces consistency in the order of execution of these futures above and beyond the out-of-the-box
     * CompletableFuture functionality.
     *
     * Firstly, rather than just waiting for future1 and future2 to complete prior to executing "child future", this
     * method will guarantee that any child futures created by future1 and future2 have also completed, and any further
     * descendants too.
     *
     * Secondly, this method registers "child future" with {@link AsyncFuturesHolder} so that we can wait on its
     * completion prior to letting Controller methods complete.  "child future" will always be registered before any of
     * its potential child futures are registered because its execution is deferred until it is fully registered, thus
     * giving us additional consistency in the order that things are registered and executed.
