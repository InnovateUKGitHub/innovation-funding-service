            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assessment and ranking</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Project applications that pass Innovate UK scope and eligibility checks are sent to
                independent assessors who are experts in your applicationâ€™s innovation area. They score applications
                consistently in line with scoring matrices and give written feedback.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">All applications are ranked in descending order of their scores. Those below our
                quality threshold will not be successful.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Initial credit evaluation</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Our credit team reviews the project applications, business and financial information and decides which
                applications are:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>affordable, with adequate capital and enough liquidity throughout the loan period, interest cover in the availability and extension periods and debt service cover in the repayment period
                </li>
                <li>appropriate, by being close enough to market, achievable within the constraints of innovation
                    loans and well enough funded if part of a wider project

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Detailed credit evaluation</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">Our credit team will carry out detailed credit analysis of your suitability to take on a loan. We might ask you to provide us with extra information.

                committee and may not be the same as those proposed in the application.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">As part of our decision to make you a loan offer, we may invite your management team to present to our credit committee.</p>
