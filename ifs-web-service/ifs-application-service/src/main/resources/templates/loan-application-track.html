            <p class="govuk-body">Applicants that progress to the next stage will go through detailed credit
                analysis and may be offered an innovation loan. They will need to set up their project within the
                Innovation Funding Service. An applicant is successful only when they complete project setup and are
                offered a loan on the terms stated in the loan agreement and has completed project set up.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We assess applications and make lending decisions following these steps:</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assessment and ranking</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Part A applications that pass Innovate UK scope and eligibility checks are sent to 5
                independent assessors who are experts in your applicationâ€™s innovation area. They score applications
                consistently in line with scoring matrices and give written feedback.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">All applications are ranked in descending order of their scores. Those below our
                quality threshold will not be successful.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Early Metrics sends us a report based on the surveys and financial information you
                provide. Our credit team reviews these with part A and other financial information and decides which

            <p class="govuk-body">Our credit team will carry out detailed credit analysis of your suitability to
                take on a loan. We might ask you to upload extra information to a secure site. We will try not to
                make several requests. We might also ask for your consent to request credit reference agency checks of:</p>
