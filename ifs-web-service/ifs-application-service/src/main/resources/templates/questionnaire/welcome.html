        <p class="govuk-body">Innovate UK has developed a range of options for supporting its existing customers with current projects through the impacts of the pandemic, including:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Timing extensions</li>
            <li>Monthly grant payments</li>
            <li>Innovation Continuity Loans</li>
            <li>Innovation and Growth Adviser support</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Applications for Continuity Grants are now closed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The following questions are designed to help you find out whether any of the funding support options currently available work for you. Once you have identified this, we will direct you to the appropriate application form. All support is subject to status and our assessment of your application.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are looking for funding for a new project, support is also available for innovators pursuing new projects in certain areas, information on which can be found <a target="_blank" href="/competition/search">here (opens in a new window)</a>. If thereâ€™s nothing applicable to you at the moment, please keep checking this page as further opportunities will be added in future.</p>
