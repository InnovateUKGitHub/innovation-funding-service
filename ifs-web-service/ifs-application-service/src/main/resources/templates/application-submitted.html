            <li>eligible applications will be assessed independently by expert assessors</li>
            <li>each application is assessed by up to 5 assessors and against the same set criteria</li>
            <li>the assessor will score each question and provide feedback to justify those scores</li>
            <li>a panel process is held to moderate and ratify the outcome of the decision</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Decision notification</h3>
