            <h2 class="heading-large">Background</h2>
            <p>Additive manufacturing is a process that converts 3D design data into manufacturing instructions. It is game-changing technology that offers huge potential for UK businesses but there are barriers to growth. Recent research and other technology advances can help to resolve some of these barriers.</p>
            <p>Globally the market for additive manufacturing products was worth $4.1 billion in 2014 and this figure is growing annually by 35%. We estimate that the UK can win around 5% of this market. It’s a market that is set to reach £70 billion by 2025.</p>
            <p>Innovate UK has already invested over £30 million in additive manufacturing projects. This new competition is looking to address some of the remaining technical challenges.</p>
