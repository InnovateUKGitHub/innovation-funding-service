        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Stage 1</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You have already applied directly to the European Commission for an EU grant.
                Once you have heard the outcome of your EU grant application you must:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>log into your Innovation Funding Service account</li>
            <li>tell us if you have been successful or unsuccessful</li>
            <li>enter your EU grant application number which is printed on your grant letter</li>
            <li>scan and upload a copy of your EU grant letter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Verification checks</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will then undertake background compliance checks on your organisation.
            We will do checks on all consortia partners you plan to work with on your project.
            Once these are complete, we will contact you.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Stage 2</h3>
        <div class="govuk-grid-row">
            <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-half">
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If your application is successful</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body">You will proceed to stage 2 of our process.
                    You will be asked to set up your project and provide us with additional project contact details.
                    We will ask further information from the Project Manager and finance contacts for each organisation
                    in your project, including:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>re-confirmation of your project location</li>
                    <li>your organisationâ€™s bank (BACS) details if you are based in the UK</li>
                    <li>your international bank account number (IBAN) details if you are based in a British Overseas Territory</li>
                    <li>a profile of your project spend</li>
                    <li>a collaboration agreement if you are partnering with a consortia</li>
                    <li>an exploitation plan</li>

                <p class="govuk-body">This programme is an open ended competition for government-backed funding.
                    You can still submit applications to us to support any new EU grant applications you make in the future.

                    We support your EU grant applications by underwriting them with government-backed funding.</p>
