#Note for future maintenance: In this file there are checks to external links (out of IFS).
#The tests are fine as they are now, but in case those links break in the future, then we can remove those tests.
#We do not need to maintain checks towards external pages.
#However, internal links eg Terms & Conditions, do need to be maintained!!
