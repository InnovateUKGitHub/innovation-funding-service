[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

IFS tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

IFS tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

Every request must contain a valid token to call the API:
|===
| Name | Description | Example

| IFS_AUTH_TOKEN | Authentication token | curl --header "IFS_AUTH_TOKEN:testToken123" 'http://localhost:8090/application/findByUser/1' -i
|===

Every response has the following header(s):
|===
| Name | Description

| Content-Type | The Content-Type of the payload, e.g. application/json;charset=UTF-8
|===

[[overview-error-handling]]
== Error handling

A failure in the API will be reflected not only in the HTTP status code, but also in a standard error response format that will allow more specific information to be relayed to the client of the API.

The structure is of the form:

[source]
----
{
    "errors":[{

        "errorKey":"PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE",
        "arguments":["23762", "5000"],
        "errorMessage":"File upload was too large.  File was 23762 bytes but the maximum file size in bytes is 5000"

    }, {
        "errorKey":"ANOTHER_ERROR",
        ................
    }]
}
----

The errorKey and the arguments are "machine-readable" fields that can be used by client applications to take appropriate action.

The errorMessage on the other hand is an optional "human-readable" field that can be used to provide some helpful understandable information to API client developers.
