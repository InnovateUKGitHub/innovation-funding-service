 * A base class for testing services with Spring Security integrated into them.  PermissionRules-annotated beans are

 * that are available.
 *
 * Calls for Service methods and the associated Permission Rule methods that are called as a result are recorded and output
 * to a CSV report as a standard part of the testing process.
 *
 * Subclasses of this base class are therefore able to test the security annotations of their various methods by verifying
 * that individual PermissionRule methods are being called (on their owning mocks) and the same verifications auto-documented
