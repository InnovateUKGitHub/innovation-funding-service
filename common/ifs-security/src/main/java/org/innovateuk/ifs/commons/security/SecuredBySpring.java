/**
 * An Annotation that can be used to document secured methods that cannot be secured through the @PermissionRule framework.
 *
 * Examples of these would be global actions that are not related to individual entities e.g. being able to use the
 * Companies House lookup.  Whereas we could've secured the results of the Companies House call, we want to prevent
 * instead the usage of the API call altogether to prevent costs being incurred.  We have no entity to secure against in
 * this case, so we lock it down with a standard Spring Security global role check instead.
 *
 * This annotation gives us a way to add a description to standard Spring Security checks in a way that can be included
 * in the same documentation that covers the @PermissionRule mechanism
