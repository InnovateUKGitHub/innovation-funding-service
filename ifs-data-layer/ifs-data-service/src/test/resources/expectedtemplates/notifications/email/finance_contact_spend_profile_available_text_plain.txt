Dear User 2,

The finance checks for all partners in the project have now been completed. We have created a flat spend profile for your organisation's contribution to the project. This spend profile is available through your Innovate UK dashboard (https://ifs-local-dev/spend-profile).

As the designated finance contact for your organisation, you will be responsible for completing your spend profile.

If you have any other questions around these documents please contact Innovate UK using the details below.

Yours sincerely,

Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation
