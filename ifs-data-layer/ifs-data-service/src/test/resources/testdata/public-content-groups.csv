Connected digital additive manufacturing,SUMMARY,Summary,A summary
Connected digital additive manufacturing,ELIGIBILITY,Lead applicant eligibility,"To lead a project, you must:

be a UK-based business (of any size)
have at least one SME involved in your proposal
carry out your project work, and intend to exploit the results, in the UK
work alone or in collaboration with others (businesses, research base and third sector)"
Connected digital additive manufacturing,SCOPE,Project scope,"Our Emerging and Enabling Technologies programme (E&E) identifies and invests in new technologies and the underpinning capabilities that improve existing industries. Our aim is to inspire the new products, processes and services of tomorrow; those with the potential to unlock billions of pounds of value to industry and disrupt existing markets.

An emerging technology is one that is progressing in, or has recently emerged from, the research base. It allows us to do something that was not possible before. Because of this, it disrupts existing markets and enhances value to customers. It can improve our lives and lead to new sources of wealth generation.

Enabling technologies underpin the development of high-value products and services in many industrial sectors and markets. They improve performance and productivity.

The aim of this competition is to help businesses broaden out innovation activities, to find new sources of revenue from new products, processes or services. Projects will:

harness E&E technologies across the economy
develop and scale-up research and development to bring ideas, processes and products closer to availability at scale and commercial release
use design processes to understand customer motivations and behaviour and use that insight to create better products, services and processes
We are looking to fund a portfolio of projects that include:

technical feasibility
industrial research
experimental development
we will choose a portfolio that achieves a balance across topic areas, timing and costs
If your project falls outside these guidelines, please contact us at least 5 working days before the registration deadline to discuss further.

Projects must clearly show high-growth potential innovations in one or more of the following areas:

any emerging technology that can demonstrate a step change in performance and the potential to disrupt existing industrial approaches
we are particularly looking to fund projects in energy harvesting, imaging technologies, graphene or biofilms
any enabling technology in: satellite applications; electronics
sensors; photonics; digital; internet of things; data; cybersecurity
virtual or augmented reality; and distributed ledger technology
The type of innovation project will depend on the challenges and opportunities your business faces.

Proposals must show how project success will improve business growth and productivity and/or encourage export opportunities, including for at least one UK small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) involved in the project."

During this process the lead applicant will be able to invite all other collaborators. Collaborators will be sent a link, which will help them to create an account and give them access to the application."
Connected digital additive manufacturing,SUPPORTING_INFORMATION,Background and further information,"Technology is transforming our lives and brings great opportunity. The UK is strong in fundamental research across many different disciplines. However, we sometimes struggle to fully commercialise the opportunities. The most promising emerging technologies and industries need to be guided through the innovation process to market success.

Aerospace technology investment sector,SCOPE,Project scope,"Our Emerging and Enabling Technologies programme (E&E) identifies and invests in new technologies and the underpinning capabilities that improve existing industries. Our aim is to inspire the new products, processes and services of tomorrow; those with the potential to unlock billions of pounds of value to industry and disrupt existing markets.

An emerging technology is one that is progressing in, or has recently emerged from, the research base. It allows us to do something that was not possible before. Because of this, it disrupts existing markets and enhances value to customers. It can improve our lives and lead to new sources of wealth generation.

Enabling technologies underpin the development of high-value products and services in many industrial sectors and markets. They improve performance and productivity.

The aim of this competition is to help businesses broaden out innovation activities, to find new sources of revenue from new products, processes or services. Projects will:

harness E&E technologies across the economy
develop and scale-up research and development to bring ideas, processes and products closer to availability at scale and commercial release
use design processes to understand customer motivations and behaviour and use that insight to create better products, services and processes
We are looking to fund a portfolio of projects that include:

technical feasibility
industrial research
experimental development
we will choose a portfolio that achieves a balance across topic areas, timing and costs
If your project falls outside these guidelines, please contact us at least 5 working days before the registration deadline to discuss further.

Projects must clearly show high-growth potential innovations in one or more of the following areas:

any emerging technology that can demonstrate a step change in performance and the potential to disrupt existing industrial approaches
we are particularly looking to fund projects in energy harvesting, imaging technologies, graphene or biofilms
any enabling technology in: satellite applications; electronics
sensors; photonics; digital; internet of things; data; cybersecurity
virtual or augmented reality; and distributed ledger technology
The type of innovation project will depend on the challenges and opportunities your business faces.

Proposals must show how project success will improve business growth and productivity and/or encourage export opportunities, including for at least one UK small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) involved in the project."

Aerospace technology investment sector,SUPPORTING_INFORMATION,Background and further information,"Technology is transforming our lives and brings great opportunity. The UK is strong in fundamental research across many different disciplines. However, we sometimes struggle to fully commercialise the opportunities. The most promising emerging technologies and industries need to be guided through the innovation process to market success.
