Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,What is the business opportunity that your project addresses?,"Within the Industry one issue has caused progress in the field to be stifled. Up until now any advancement has been made by working around this anomaly.

We propose to tackle the situation head on and develop a tool that will circumvent the problem entirely allowing development to advance."
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,What is the size of the potential market for your project?,"The issue affects the entire field, the market value of which is significant, and accounts for a percentage of its annual overhead. A tool to reduce that amount by a significant proportion would be taken up by the entire industry.

At this time no other solutions are available or near market giving us the leading edge on market share.

Manufacture and development could remain in the United Kingdom with an international export market.

"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,How will you exploit and market your project?,"The planned end result of the project would be a fully implementable tool that could be rolled out to the industry.

Once a fully tested prototype can be demonstrated we can start to take orders and travel to international Industry leaders the exhibit the value of the tool."
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,"What economic, social and environmental benefits do you expect your project to deliver and when?","The tool will give the consortium the leading edge on the technology as currently no one else is close to considering developing a solution.

The Industry will be able to reduce wastage by a significant degree and pass those savings on to the consumer or reinvest into advancing the field.

Inside 2 years it is estimated that a very large sum of money can be recouped by using our solution"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,What technical approach will you use and how will you manage your project?,"Our Academic partner has developed a technique to identify the precise cause of the issue and have been able to demonstrate it at a small scale. Taking this information they will scale up the experiment to a percentage of industrial scale to confirm.

We will take this data and engineer a solution to isolate the problem we will then collude with our fabrication partner to design and prototype a tool to correct the obstacle."
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,What is innovative about your project?,"The project is based on Manchester?s novel IP that, for the first time, allows SLM to be conducted without any need for anchors/supports. A search of the literature has established that the advances proposed in this project on which RAMP are based are not available via any commercially available process. In addition, the development and supply of tailored materials by Empire and a dedicated high temperature rig by Ludlow will involve further, critical degrees of innovation that will help to build a portfolio of IP to enhance commercial exploitation. NB. RAMP does not simply reduce stresses by working at higher temperatures; it involves a novel step based on manufacturing engineering and material science that completely eliminates stresses.

"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,"What are the risks (technical, commercial and environmental) to your project's success? What is your risk management strategy?","Three principal risks exist at this stage:

The academic scale up fails to replicate the smaller results either entirely or not to a satisfactory level. In this event the academic partner would begin a controlled scale back to identify if the method needs to be altered during scale up to replicate results. In the event that the issue can only be identified in the small scale we would build that into our planning for the isolation phase

During the phase to engineer a technique to isolate the issue we anticipate that there are inherent safety issues. We have consulted an independent firm to ensure that suitable equipment and measures have been put in place to minimise the risk to staff.

Although we are confident that our fabrication partner is the best option for the prototype solution there is an indication that a particular piece of heavy machinery, currently unavailable in the UK will be required. Our Fabrication partner has already investigated options for accessing this equipment in the Far East and an appropriate budget has been set aside to be used for this purpose if required.


"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,"Does your project team have the skills, experience and facilities to deliver this project?","The team consists of:

Us - We have been supplying engineering solutions to the industry for a number of years and have been principal deliverers for various advancements within the field. We are a suitably sized team capable of developing flexible solutions to a wide variety of clients internationally.

Academic ? the principal investigator and his team have been studying the issue for a number of years and have qualifications across the spectrum that apply to the field. Together they have already identified several efficiencies that can be made within the industry.

The Fabricators ? Are a leading team within complex engineering fabrication. They have work on multiple high budget engineering solutions and consist of a team of people with many years? experience in a range of industries
"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,What will your project cost?,"The amount of money needed to complete this project is large.

The academic phase will require the acquisition of several pieces of lab equipment and the employ of additional graduates to ensure the experiments run smoothly.

The Materials and use of the fabricators equipment will account for approximately some of the budget.

The time and expertise required across all 3 partners to complete each phase will amount to the lion share of the cost.

"
Rolling stock future developments - Assessor as a Service,New materials for lighter stock,How does financial support from Innovate UK and its funding partners add value?,"Although steps are under way to get this project off the ground, investment by Innovate UK will stimulate Industry leads to supply additional resource funding and use of their facilities as required to advance the progress of this project.

UK Investment will ensure that we are able to retain the onward manufacture internally instead of needing to create international deals taking work and profit out of the country."
