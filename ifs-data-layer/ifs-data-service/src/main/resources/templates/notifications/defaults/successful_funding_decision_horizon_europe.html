<p>We are pleased to inform you that your application for the Horizon Europe collaborative competition has been successful and passed the technical assessment phase.</p>
<p>Before we can provide you with your Grant Offer Letter, Innovate UK will conduct a finance review and require the submission of additional documentation. This process is managed through your <a href="https://auth.apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk">online dashboard</a>, where full details are provided under ‘set up your project’.</p>
<p>Please ensure you provide details of your finance contact via your dashboard by close of business on XXXXX. To allow your project to start promptly, additional documents must be submitted via your dashboard as soon as possible. We will contact you with any queries and you should ensure these are addressed by yourself and any collaborators in a timely manner, as we are unable to issue your Grant Offer Letter if queries are outstanding.</p>
<p>Upon satisfactory completion of the above, Innovate UK will issue your Grant Offer Letter which must be signed, uploaded and approved before your project is able to start. <u>You must not start your project until you have returned your signed grant offer letter.</u></p>
<p><strong>If you do not start your project within 90 days of this letter, funding may be withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p>We will confirm once all pre-start work is complete.</p>
