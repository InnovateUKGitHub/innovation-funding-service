# Single service deploy can be achieved by setting the properties below to a specific version
# The osUpgradeXX tasks work by only deploying versions that are different to what is currently deployed
# oc describe pod <pod_name>.  As an example if the current deployed version is 1.1.23-RELEASE
# and we only want to deploy the data service. we would set:
#
# version=1.1.23-RELEASE
# data-service.version=1.1.24-RELEASE
# All other properties below would remain commented out.
#
# If we wish to do a full system deploy we would ensure that all properties below are commented out
# and we would simply specify:
# version=<new version number>
